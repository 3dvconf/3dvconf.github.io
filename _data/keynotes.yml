   # title: "The Revolution of Neural Rendering"
   # abstract: "In this talk, I will present our research vision in how to create a photo-realistic digital replica of the real world, and how to make holograms become a reality. Eventually, I would like to see photos and videos evolve to become interactive, holographic content indistinguishable from the real world. Imagine taking such 3D photos to share with friends, family, or social media; the ability to fully record historical moments for future generations; or to provide content for upcoming augmented and virtual reality applications. AI-based approaches, such as generative neural networks, are becoming more and more popular in this context since they have the potential to transform existing image synthesis pipelines. I will specifically talk about an avenue towards neural rendering where we can retain the full control of a traditional graphics pipeline but at the same time exploit modern capabilities of deep learning, such as handling the imperfections of content from commodity 3D scans. While the capture and photo-realistic synthesis of imagery open up unbelievable possibilities for applications ranging from entertainment to communication industries, there are also important ethical considerations that must be kept in mind. Specifically, in the content of fabricated news (e.g., fake-news), it is critical to highlight and understand digitally-manipulated content. I believe that media forensics plays an important role in this area, both from an academic standpoint to better understand image and video manipulation, but even more importantly from a societal standpoint to create and raise awareness around the possibilities and moreover, to highlight potential avenues and solutions regarding trust of digital content."

   # abstract: "3D (or 6D, or 9D) pose estimation of objects from images has made tremendous progress over the recent past years, but is it really enough to answer all needs, especially for the industry?  Requirements for training time and for labeled data are still often a deal breaker to transfer these developments to production.  In the first part of this talk, I will present our recent work on dealing with new objects without specific training on them: How to detect them, how to estimate their 6D pose, how to track them.  I will then present our work on creating accurate annotations of real images automatically for training and evaluating 3D algorithms: In particular, we recently developed a method based on the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to retrieve CAD models for indoor scenes from noisy RGB-D scans without human input."

   # title: "Human-Centric 3D Computer Vision for Future AI Systems"
   # abstract: "Future AI systems such as personalized healthcare robots, self-driving cars, and AR/VR-based telepresence systems, will only be safe, useful and widely adopted if they are able to interpret human pose, shape and appearance at levels rivaling our own; and if they can interact with us and the world in a human-like and natural fashion. This requires perceiving and analyzing human behavior from images. It also requires generation, control and synthesis of virtual humans. To this end we propose a novel representation of human pose, shape and appearance that combines the advantages of neural implicit surfaces with those of parametric body models: i) a continuous and resolution-independent surface representation that can capture highly detailed geometry and can naturally model topology changes, ii) coupled with the ease of use and generalization capabilities to unseen shapes and poses of polygonal mesh-based models. We also introduce algorithms to learn such representations without requiring manually specified skinning weights or other forms of direct supervision.  We then discuss how to leverage this representation to reconstruct controllable avatars (full body, faces and more) directly from images, videos or short RGB-D sequences via differentiable rendering. Finally, to make 3D human avatars widely available, we will discuss work towards generative modeling of 3D virtual humans with diverse identities and shapes in arbitrary poses and of interactions with 3D objects in a physically plausible manner."

   title: "Towards 4D Reality Capture"
   abstract: "We live in a dynamic three dimensional world that is full of life, with agents like people who interact with each other and their environment in their daily life. But motion is not only restricted to people, but everywhere we see: in the leaves rusted by the breeze, a bird chirping in the tree, a passing cloud over the sun.. How can we perceive and capture this 4D world? In this talk, I will paint the ambitious goal of capturing the photorealistic 4D world in a casual manner, like from everyday smartphone videos. While this is quite a challenge, with recent advances in analysis-by-synthesis and 3D neural field representations like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), we have come far in the ability to capture the static 3D world in a photorealistic manner. I will discuss the recent advancements that make static 3D capture practical, and then discuss the challenges thereby in capturing the dynamic, non-rigid world in the general case from a monocular capture setup. I will then discuss the progress that can be made on deformable objects with known kinematic structure and 3D poses, and recent advancements in 3D perception of people from videos that can come into play."

   title: "Learning 3D Representations of Shape and Deformations"
   abstract: "As humans we take the ability to perceive the dynamic world around us in three dimensions for granted. From an early age we can grasp an object by adapting our fingers to its 3D shape; or effortlessly navigate through a busy street. These tasks require some internal 3D representation of shape, deformations, and motion. Building algorithms that can emulate human 3D perception, using as input single images or video sequences taken with a consumer camera, has proved to be an extremely hard task. Machine learning solutions have faced the challenge of the scarcity of 3D annotations, encouraging important advances in weak and self-supervision. In this talk I will describe progress from early optimization-based solutions that captured sequence-specific 3D models with primitive representations of deformation, towards recent and more powerful 3D-aware neural representations that can learn the variation of shapes and textures across a category and be trained from 2D image supervision only. There has been very successful recent commercial uptake of this technology and I will show exciting applications to AI-driven video synthesis."

   title:  "Learning digital humans for the Metaverse"
   abstract: "The Metaverse will require artificial humans that interact with real humans as well as with real and virtual 3D worlds. This requires a real-time understanding of humans and scenes as well as the generation of natural and appropriate behavior. We approach the problem of creating such embodied human behavior through capture, modeling, and synthesis. First, we learn realistic and expressive 3D human avatars from 3D scans. We then train neural networks to estimate human pose and shape from images and video. Specifically, we focus on humans interacting with each other and the 3D world. By capturing people in action, we are able to train neural networks to model and generate human movement and human-scene interaction. To validate our models, we synthesize virtual humans in novel 3D scenes. The goal is to produce realistic human avatars that interact with virtual worlds in ways that are indistinguishable from real humans."

PAI utilizes the photoacoustic effect for shape recovery that materials emit acoustic signals under light irradiation.  What makes PAI different from ordinary 3D sensing is PAI can provide 3D geometric structure associated with wavelength-dependent absorption information of the interior of a target in a non-invasive manner. In this talk, I will introduce various shape recovery methods focusing on the properties of light such as absorption and refraction: 3D modeling by PAI,  shape from water, shape from chromatic aberration, and shape from fluorescence."

   abstract: "Future robots, AI assistants and mixed reality in the Metaverse will be greatly enhanced by enabling rich predictive 3D models with far greater context about our physical reality than is possible today. Such models will require a live and updating model of reality capturing what is in our environments and how we interact within them. To obtain this context we will need to observe reality at greater sensing fidelity than has previously been possible, wherever we are, whenever we need it. Upcoming generations of robots and wearable devices like AR glasses enable always-on mobile sensing, computations and communications to push the observability of reality to the limit - observing reality change as a user or robot interacts in the environment. In this talk I will provide an overview of key stages in building a scalable, predictive 3D model of reality that is kept up-to-date by egocentric data from AR glasses and future robots. I'll chart a course in my research that has persuaded me this is the foundation on which contextualized AI can be built to power the future of robotics, AI assistants and mixed reality worlds in the Metaverse."

We will discuss models that learn to  map 2D and 2.5D  images and videos into amodal completed  3D feature maps of the scene and the objects in it by predicting views. We will show the proposed models learn object permanence, have objects  emerge in 3D without human annotations, can ground language in 3D visual simulations, and learn intuitive physics and controllers that generalize across scene arrangements and camera configurations. In this way, the proposed world-centric  scene representations  overcome many limitations of  image-centric representations for video understanding, model learning and language grounding."
