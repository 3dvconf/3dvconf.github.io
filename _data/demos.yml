- title: "Web application to generate synthetic geometric camera calibration dataset for stereo cameras"
  id: 1
  authors: "Lala Shakti Swarup Ray, Sungho Suh, Bo Zhou, and Paul Lukowicz"
  abstract: "Camera calibration provides identical output for any given input regardless of forms of environmental conditions. It is highly essential for systems involving cameras to decipher the tiniest possible change prior to any other computer vision algorithms in the pipeline. Thus, this requires the camera to be calibrated to attain higher accuracy and low distortion which helps in achieving a more accurate representation of the real world within different captured images. It is hard to replicate the real-world environment and exact positions for capturing the calibration pattern to create calibration datasets for specific setups. In this demo, we present a webbased interface that can be used to generate a synthetic camera calibration dataset with ground truth, which then can be used to evaluate the accuracy of camera calibration algorithms based on Zhang´s method."

  abstract: "This demo showcases a medical augmented echography use case. A lightweight 3D printed shape marker is attached to an echography probe, and the computed marker pose data can be used to register 2D echography plane over other modalities: video, x-ray… to cover needs such as needle biopsy or surgery guidance."

  abstract: "Indoor networking surveillance has been widely used in many public aeras for various purposes such as monitoring and nursing. Although it can provide users with real-time pictures of the physical world, the scattered and isolated pictures cannot help users form a complete perception of the environment. This paper addresses the above challenge by proposing a digital twin system for indoor networking surveillance (DTS4INS), from which people’s positions, motions and identities can be thoroughly and panoramically viewed in a real-time and synchronous VR world of the physical surveillance environment."

   id: 1
   authors: "Alexey Nekrasov, Jonas Schult, Or Litany, Bastian Leibe and Francis Engelmann"
   abstract: "During this demo, we will demonstrate our model Mix3D [7] for semantic segmentation on 3D scenes. Mix3D is trained specifically to generalize beyond the structural priors of current 3D datasets. Since most indoor 3D datasets are very similar in terms of training and test set distributions, the actual generalization capabilities of our approach do not become apparent on these datasets. Therefore, in this demo, we apply our Mix3D model, and competing methods, to newly recorded challenging “in-the-wild” 3D scenes. Besides demonstrating the improved generalization capabilities of Mix3D, we also want to identify its limitations and failure cases. To this end, we challenge the participants of the demo to scan and upload their own 3D scenes, with the goal to make our model fail. The most interesting failure cases will be presented live during the demo.<br>Website to upload 3D scans before the Demo presentation: <a href=\"https://mix3d-demo.nekrasov.dev/\">https://mix3d-demo.nekrasov.dev/</a>"
 - title: "TANDEM: Tracking and Dense Mapping in Real-time using Deep Multi-view Stereo"
   id: 2
   authors: "Lukas Koestler, Nan Yang, Niclas Zeller and Daniel Cremers"
   abstract: "This demo will show a live room-scale reconstruction from a handheld monocular camera using TANDEM [3]. For pose estimation, TANDEM performs photometric bundle adjustment based on a sliding window of keyframes. To increase the robustness, we propose a novel tracking frontend that performs dense direct image alignment using depthmaps rendered from a global model that is built incrementally from dense depth predictions. To predict the dense depth maps, we propose Cascade View-Aggregation MVS-Net (CVA-MVSNet) that utilizes the entire active keyframe window by hierarchically constructing 3D cost volumes with adaptive view aggregation to balance the different stereo baselines between the keyframes. Finally, the predicted depth maps are fused into a consistent global map represented as a truncated signed distance function (TSDF) grid."

   id: 3
   authors: "Fabien Baradel, Romain Bregier, Philippe Weinzaepfel, Yannis Kalantidis and Gregory Rogez"
   abstract: "We propose to showcase a real-time demonstration of 3D hand mesh recovery from an input video stream. In our demo, given a monocular (webcam) video input, the hand pose detected is used to animate a robotic hand in real-time, using a kinematic retargetting procedure. Figure 1 shows a screenshot from a physical installation of our demo in our building. When utilizing the connected webcam as input, our demo runs at 30 FPS on an Nvidia RTX 2080 GPU; the demo can also be adapted to accept remote webcam video as input."
 - title: "RealisticHands: A Hybrid Model for 3D Hand Reconstruction"
   id: 4
   authors: "Michael Seeber, Roi Poranne, Marc Polleyfeys and Martin R. Oswald"
   abstract: "Estimating 3D hand meshes from RGB images robustly is a highly desirable task, made challenging due to the numerous degrees of freedom, and issues such as self-similarity and occlusions. Previous methods generally either use parametric 3D hand models or follow a model-free approach. While the former can be considered more robust, e.g. to occlusions, they are less expressive. We propose a hybrid approach, utilizing a deep neural network and differential rendering based optimization to demonstrably achieve the best of both worlds. In addition, we explore Virtual Reality (VR) as an application. Most VR headsets are nowadays equipped with multiple cameras, which we can leverage by extending our method to the egocentric stereo domain. This extension proves to be more resilient to the above mentioned issues. Finally, as a use-case, we show that the improved image-model alignment can be used to acquire the user’s hand texture, which leads to a more realistic virtual hand representation. In the demo we plan to showcase how our method reconstructs a textured 3D mesh from a camera stream. "

   id: 5
   authors: "Kumar Abhinav, Alpana Dubey and Suma Mani Kuriakose"
   abstract: "As we move towards product customization, additive manufacturing, and extended reality environments, the demand for 3D models is ever increasing. This increasing demand has given rise to multiple 3D design softwares. These softwares help in modeling, analyzing, and translating 3D models. However, there is still a lack of tools to aid in designer’s creativity. In this work, we present an approach for 3D style transfer to bridge this gap. "
 - title: "Sketch-to-3D (S3D) Design Assistant"
   id: 6
   authors: "Nitish Bhardwaj, Dhornala Bharadwaj, Alpana Dubey, Kumar Abhinav and Suma Mani Kuriakose"
   abstract: "Design process of a 3D model starts from raw handdrawn sketches. These sketches are further used to search a 3D model from the repository or generate a 3D model from scratch. Current methods to generate 3D models from sketches are either manual or tightly coupled with 3D modeling platforms. CAD tools like Autodesk, CATIA have developed software solutions to design 3D models from sketches. Sketching in these tools can easily help in 3D modelling but it requires high expertise and vast knowledge of the tool. These tools require professional artistic skills for sketching in 3D interface. Moreover, most of the existing approaches are based on geometric manipulation and thus cannot be generalized. In this work, we present Sketch-to-3D (S3D) design assistant, which helps the designers and stakeholders to acquire a better foundation in their design process. S3D design assistant is built using advanced deep neural network-based approaches offering two functionalities: SearchForSketch (SFS) and SingleSketch2Mesh (SS2M)."
