title: "Learning Residue-Aware Correlation Filters and Refining Scale Estimates for Real-Time UAV Tracking"
authors: "Shuiwang Li, Yuting Liu, Qijun Zhao and Ziliang Feng"
abstract: "Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based tracking is attracting increasing attention and developing rapidly in applications such as agriculture, aviation, navigation, transportation and public security. Recently, discriminative correlation filters (DCF)-based trackers have stood out in UAV tracking community for their high efficiency and appealing robustness on a single CPU. However, due to limited onboard computation resources and requirement of low power the efficiency and accuracy of existing DCF-based approaches is still not satisfying. In this paper, inspired by residue representation, we exploit the residue nature inherent to videos and propose residue-aware correlation filters that show better convergence properties in filter learning. Moreover, we explore using segmentation by the GrabCut to improve the wildly adopted discriminative scale estimation in DCF-based trackers, which, as a mater of fact, greatly impacts the precision and accuracy of the trackers since accumulated scale error degrades the appearance model as online updating goes on. Extensive experiments are conducted on four UAV benchmarks, namely, UAV123@10fps, DTB70, UAVDT and Vistrone2018 (VisDrone2018-test-dev). The results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance."
