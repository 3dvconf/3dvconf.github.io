title: "Efficiently Distributed Watertight Surface Reconstruction"
authors: "Laurent Caraffa, Yanis Marchand, Mathieu Bredif and Bruno Vallet"
abstract: "We present an out-of-core and distributed surface reconstruction algorithm which scales efficiently on arbitrarily large point clouds (with optical centres) and produces a 3D watertight triangle mesh representing the surface of the underlying scene.
 Surface reconstruction from a point cloud is a difficult problem and existing state of the art approaches are usually based on complex pipelines making use of global algorithms (i.e. Delaunay triangulation, graph-cut optimisation).
 For one of these approaches, we investigate the distribution of all the steps (in particular Delaunay triangulation and graph-cut optimisation) in order to propose a fully scalable method. We show that the problem can be tiled and distributed across a cloud or a cluster of PCs by paying a careful attention to the interactions between tiles and using Spark computing framework. We confirm the efficiency of this approach with an in-depth quantitative evaluation and the successful reconstruction of a surface from a very large data set which combines more than 350 million aerial and terrestrial LiDAR points."
