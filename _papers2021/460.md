title: "3D Reconstruction of Novel Object Shapes from Single Images"
authors: "Anh Thai, Stefan Stojanov, Vijay Upadhya and James Rehg"
abstract: "Accurately predicting the 3D shape of any arbitrary object in any pose from a single image is a key goal of computer vision research. This is challenging as it requires a model to learn a representation that can infer both the visible and occluded portions of any object using a limited training set. A training set that covers all possible object shapes is inherently infeasible. Such learning-based approaches are inherently vulnerable to overfitting, and successfully implementing them is a function of both the architecture design and the training approach. We present an extensive investigation of factors specific to architecture design, training, experiment design, and evaluation that influence reconstruction performance and measurement. We show that our proposed SDFNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on seen and unseen shapes relative to existing methods GenRe and OccNet. We provide the first large-scale evaluation of single image shape reconstruction to unseen objects. The source code released with this article will allow for the consistent evaluation of methods for single image shape reconstruction."
