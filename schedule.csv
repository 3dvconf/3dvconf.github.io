Poster 1,Oral 1,237,Field-of-View Agnostic Depth Estimation for Cross-Dataset Generalization,"Daniel Lichy (NVIDIA Research), Hang Su (NVIDIA Research), Abhishek Badki (NVIDIA Research), Jan Kautz (NVIDIA Research), Orazio Gallo (NVIDIA Research)","Wide field-of-view (FoV) cameras efficiently capture large portions of the scene, which makes them attractive in multiple domains, such as automotive and robotics. For such applications, estimating depth from multiple images is a critical task, and therefore, a large amount of ground truth (GT) data is available. Unfortunately, most of the GT data is for pinhole cameras, making it impossible to properly train depth estimation models for large-FoV cameras. We propose the first method to train a stereo depth estimation model on the widely available pinhole data, and to generalize it to data captured with larger FoVs. Our intuition is simple: We warp the training data to a canonical, large-FoV representation and augment it to allow a single network to reason about diverse types of distortions that otherwise would prevent generalization. We show strong generalization ability of our approach on both indoor and outdoor datasets, which was not possible with previous methods.",https://openreview.net/forum?id=R3wd1ZvU6F
Poster 1,Oral 1,80,LFM-3D: Learnable Feature Matching Across Wide Baselines Using 3D Signals,"Arjun Karpur (Google Research), Guilherme Mendeleh Perrotta (Google Research), Ricardo Martin Brualla (Google Research), Howard Zhou (Google Research), Andre Araujo (Google Research)","Finding localized correspondences across different images of the same object is crucial to understand its geometry. In recent years, this problem has seen remarkable progress with the advent of deep learning-based local image features and learnable matchers. Still, learnable matchers often underperform when there exists only small regions of co-visibility between image pairs (i.e. wide camera baselines). To address this problem, we leverage recent progress in coarse single-view geometry estimation methods. We propose LFM-3D, a Learnable Feature Matching framework that uses models based on graph neural networks and enhances their capabilities by integrating noisy, estimated 3D signals to boost correspondence estimation. When integrating 3D signals into the matcher model, we show that a suitable positional encoding is critical to effectively make use of the low-dimensional 3D information. We experiment with two different 3D signals - normalized object coordinates and monocular depth estimates - and evaluate our method on large-scale (synthetic and real) datasets containing object-centric image pairs across wide baselines. We observe strong feature matching improvements compared to 2D-only methods, with up to +6% total recall and +28% precision at fixed recall. Additionally, we demonstrate that the resulting improved correspondences lead to much higher relative posing accuracy for in-the-wild image pairs - up to 8.6% compared to the 2D-only approach.",https://openreview.net/forum?id=cJX2drc7y4
Poster 1,Oral 1,198,SCENES: Subpixel Correspondence Estimation with Epipolar Supervision,"Dominik Kloepfer (University of Oxford), Dylan Campbell (University of Oxford), Joao F. Henriques (University of Oxford)","Extracting point correspondences from two or more views of a scene is a fundamental computer vision problem with particular importance for relative camera pose estimation and structure-from-motion. Existing local feature matching approaches, trained with correspondence supervision on large-scale datasets, obtain highly-accurate matches on the test sets. However, they do not generalise well to new datasets with different characteristics to those they were trained on, unlike classic feature extractors. Instead, they require finetuning, which assumes that ground-truth correspondences or ground-truth camera poses and 3D structure are available. We relax this assumption by removing the requirement of 3D structure, e.g., depth maps or point clouds, and only require camera pose information, which can be obtained from odometry. We do so by replacing correspondence losses with epipolar losses, which encourage putative matches to lie on the associated epipolar line. While weaker than correspondence supervision, we observe that this cue is sufficient for finetuning existing models on new data. We then further relax the assumption of known camera poses by using pose estimates in a novel bootstrapping approach. We evaluate on highly challenging datasets, including an indoor drone dataset and an outdoor smartphone camera dataset, and obtain state-of-the-art results without strong supervision.",https://openreview.net/forum?id=RMgrY57XLH
Poster 2,Oral 2,361,NICER-SLAM: Neural Implicit Scene Encoding for RGB SLAM,"Zihan Zhu (University of Tuebingen), Songyou Peng (University of Tuebingen), Viktor Larsson (University of Tuebingen), Zhaopeng Cui (University of Tuebingen), Martin R. Oswald (University of Tuebingen), Andreas Geiger (University of Tuebingen), Marc Pollefeys (University of Tuebingen)","Neural implicit representations have recently become popular in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), especially in dense visual SLAM. However, previous works in this direction either rely on RGB-D sensors, or require a separate monocular SLAM approach for camera tracking and do not produce high-fidelity dense 3D scene reconstruction. In this paper, we present NICER-SLAM, a dense RGB SLAM system that simultaneously optimizes for camera poses and a hierarchical neural implicit map representation, which also allows for high-quality novel view synthesis. To facilitate the optimization process for mapping, we integrate additional supervision signals including easy-to-obtain monocular geometric cues and optical flow, and also introduce a simple warping loss to further enforce geometry consistency. Moreover, to further boost performance in complicated indoor scenes, we also propose a local adaptive transformation from signed distance functions (SDFs) to density in the volume rendering equation. On both synthetic and real-world datasets we demonstrate strong performance in dense mapping, tracking, and novel view synthesis, even competitive with recent RGB-D SLAM systems.",https://openreview.net/forum?id=GKqofA1izi
Poster 2,Oral 2,337,SlimmeRF: Slimmable Radiance Fields,"Shiran Yuan (Tsinghua University, Tsinghua University), Hao Zhao (Tsinghua University, Tsinghua University)","Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) and its variants have recently emerged as successful methods for novel view synthesis and 3D scene reconstruction. However, most current NeRF models either achieve high accuracy using large model sizes, or achieve high memory-efficiency by trading off accuracy. This limits the applicable scope of any single model, since high-accuracy models might not fit in low-memory devices, and memory-efficient models might not satisfy high-quality requirements. To this end, we present SlimmeRF, a model that allows for instant test-time trade-offs between model size and accuracy through slimming, thus making the model simultaneously suitable for scenarios with different computing budgets. We achieve this through a newly proposed algorithm named Tensorial Rank Incrementation (TRaIn) which increases the rank of the model's tensorial representation gradually during training. We also observe that our model allows for more effective trade-offs in sparse-view scenarios, at times even achieving higher accuracy after being slimmed. We credit this to the fact that erroneous information such as floaters tend to be stored in components corresponding to higher ranks.",https://openreview.net/forum?id=52JGaL9Vhp

To step toward object reconstruction in the wild, this work explores reconstructing general real-world objects from a few images without known camera poses or object categories. The crux of our work is solving two fundamental 3D vision problems -- shape reconstruction and pose estimation -- in a unified approach. Our approach captures the synergies of these two problems: reliable camera pose estimation gives rise to accurate shape reconstruction, and the accurate reconstruction, in turn, induces robust correspondence between different views and facilitates pose estimation. Our method FORGE predicts 3D features from each view and leverages them in conjunction with the input images to establish cross-view correspondence for estimating relative camera poses. The 3D features are then transformed by the estimated poses into a shared space and are fused into a neural radiance field. The reconstruction results are rendered by volume rendering techniques, enabling us to train the model without 3D shape ground-truth. Our experiments show that FORGE reliably reconstructs objects from five views. Our pose estimation method outperforms existing ones by a large margin. The reconstruction results under predicted poses are comparable to the ones using ground-truth poses. The performance on novel testing categories matches the results on categories seen during training.",https://openreview.net/forum?id=cbqMMORP3p
Poster 3,Oral 3,316,Relative Pose for Nonrigid Multi-Perspective Cameras: The Static Case,"Min Li (ShanghaiTech University), Jiaqi Yang (ShanghaiTech University), Laurent Kneip (ShanghaiTech University)","Multi-perspective cameras with potentially non-overlapping fields of view have become an important exteroceptive sensing modality in a number of applications such as intelligent vehicles, drones, and mixed reality headsets. In this work, we challenge one of the basic assumptions made in these scenarios, which is that the multi-camera rig is rigid. More specifically, we are considering the problem of estimating the relative pose between a static non-rigid rig in different spatial orientations while taking into account the effect of gravity onto the system. The deformable physical connections between each camera and the body center are approximated by a simple cantilever model, and inserted into the generalized epipolar constraint. Our results lead us to the important insight that the latent parameters of the deformation model, meaning the gravity vector in both views, become observable. We present a concise analysis of the observability of all variables based on noise, outliers, and rig rigidity for two different algorithms. The first one is a vision-only alternative, while the second one makes use of additional gravity measurements. To conclude, we demonstrate the ability to sense gravity in a real-world example, and discuss practical implications.",https://openreview.net/forum?id=A1NWxAAEon
Poster 3,Oral 3,44,POCO: 3D Pose and Shape Estimation with Confidence,"Sai Kumar Dwivedi (Google), Cordelia Schmid (Google), Hongwei Yi (Google), Michael J. Black (Google), Dimitrios Tzionas (Google)","The regression of 3D Human Pose and Shape (HPS) from an image is becoming increasingly accurate. This makes the results useful for downstream tasks like human action recognition or 3D graphics. Yet, no regressor is perfect, and accuracy can be affected by ambiguous image evidence or by poses and appearance that are unseen during training. Most current HPS regressors, however, do not report the confidence of their outputs, meaning that downstream tasks cannot differentiate accurate estimates from inaccurate ones. To address this, we develop POCO, a novel framework for training HPS regressors to estimate not only a 3D human body, but also their confidence, in a single feed-forward pass. Specifically, POCO estimates both the 3D body pose and a per-sample variance. The key idea is to introduce a Dual Conditioning Strategy (DCS) for regressing uncertainty that is highly correlated to pose reconstruction quality. The POCO framework can be applied to any HPS regressor and here we evaluate it by modifying HMR, PARE, and CLIFF. In all cases, training the network to reason about uncertainty helps it learn to more accurately estimate 3D pose. While this was not our goal, the improvement is modest but consistent. Our main motivation is to provide uncertainty estimates for downstream tasks; we demonstrate this in two ways: (1) We use the confidence estimates to bootstrap HPS training. Given unlabelled image data, we take the confident estimates of a POCO-trained regressor as pseudo ground truth. Retraining with this automatically-curated data improves accuracy. (2) We exploit uncertainty in video pose estimation by automatically identifying uncertain frames (e.g. due to occlusion) and inpainting these from confident frames.",https://openreview.net/forum?id=ost30uBkNa

Zhang (School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University), Deva Ramanan (School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University), Shubham Tulsiani (School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University)","We address the task of estimating 6D camera poses from sparse-view image sets (2-8 images). This task is a vital pre-processing stage for nearly all contemporary (neural) reconstruction algorithms but remains challenging given sparse views, especially for objects with visual symmetries and texture-less surfaces. We build on the recent RelPose framework which learns a network that infers distributions over relative rotations over image pairs. We extend this approach in two key ways; first, we use attentional transformer layers to process multiple images jointly, since additional views of an object may resolve ambiguous symmetries in any given image pair (such as the handle of a mug that becomes visible in a third view). Second, we augment this network to also report camera translations by defining an appropriate coordinate system that decouples the ambiguity in rotation estimation from translation prediction. Our final system results in large improvements in 6D pose prediction over prior art on both seen and unseen object categories and also enables pose estimation and 3D reconstruction for in-the-wild objects.",https://openreview.net/forum?id=uZ8ESZnyxh

Poster 4,Oral 4,108,Multi-Body Neural Scene Flow,"Kavisha Vidanapathirana (Queensland University of Technology), Shin-Fang Chng (Queensland University of Technology), Xueqian Li (Queensland University of Technology), Simon Lucey (Queensland University of Technology)","The test-time optimization of scene flow - using a coordinate network as a neural prior - has gained popularity due to its simplicity, lack of dataset bias, and state-of-the-art performance. We observe, however, that although coordinate networks capture general motions by implicitly regularizing the scene flow predictions to be spatially smooth, the neural prior by itself is unable to identify the underlying multi-body rigid motions present in real-world data. To address this, we show that multi-body rigidity can be achieved without the cumbersome and brittle strategy of constraining the SE(3) parameters of each rigid body as done in previous works. This is achieved by regularizing the scene flow optimization to encourage isometry in flow predictions for rigid bodies. This strategy enables multi-body rigidity in scene flow while maintaining a continuous flow field, hence allowing dense long-term scene flow integration across a sequence of point clouds. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets and demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art in 3D scene flow and long-term point-wise 4D trajectory prediction.",https://openreview.net/forum?id=vk4NxoZXJm

Material-specific parameters are used by the formulation to control the garment inextensibility. This delivers unrealistic results with physically implausible stretching. Oftentimes, the draped garment is pushed inside the body which is either corrected by an expensive post-processing, thus adding to further inconsistent stretching; or by deploying a separate training regime for each body type, restricting its scalability. Additionally, the flawed skinning process deployed by existing methods produces incorrect results on loose garments.",https://openreview.net/forum?id=qzhH0bElx9

Richter (Intel), Shenlong Wang (Intel), German Ros (Intel)","Reconstructing an object from photos and placing it virtually in a new environment goes beyond the standard novel view synthesis task as the appearance of the object has to not only adapt to the novel viewpoint but also to the new lighting conditions and yet evaluations of inverse rendering methods rely on novel view synthesis data or simplistic synthetic datasets for quantitative analysis. This work presents a real-world dataset for measuring the reconstruction and rendering of objects for relighting. To this end, we capture the environment lighting and ground truth images of the same objects in multiple environments allowing to reconstruct the objects from images taken in one environment and quantify the quality of the rendered views for the unseen lighting environments. Further, we introduce a simple baseline composed of off-the-shelf methods and test several state-of-the-art methods on the relighting task and show that novel view synthesis is not a reliable proxy to measure performance.",https://openreview.net/forum?id=wjOunOQJLk

Prior work investigated the unrealistic setting where all input images only contain a single openable object. We generalize this task to scenes with multiple objects each potentially possessing openable parts, and create a corresponding dataset based on real-world scenes. We then address this more challenging scenario with OPDFormer: a part-aware transformer architecture. Our experiments show that the OPDFormer architecture significantly outperforms prior work. The more realistic multiple-object scenarios we investigated remain challenging for all methods, indicating opportunities for future work.",https://openreview.net/forum?id=zPo32mHBDr
Poster 5,Oral 5,19,Scalable 3D Panoptic Segmentation with Superpoint Graph Clustering,"Damien Robert (University of Zurich), Hugo Raguet (University of Zurich), Loic Landrieu (University of Zurich)","We introduce a highly efficient method for panoptic segmentation of large 3D point clouds by redefining this task as a scalable graph clustering problem. This approach can be trained using only local auxiliary tasks, thereby eliminating the resource-intensive instance-matching step during training. Moreover, our formulation can easily be adapted to the superpoint paradigm, further increasing its efficiency. This allows our model to process scenes with millions of points and thousands of objects in a single inference. Our method, called SuperCluster, achieves a new state-of-the-art panoptic segmentation performance for two indoor scanning datasets: 50.1 PQ (+7.8) for S3DIS Area~5, and 58.7 PQ (+25.2) for ScanNetV2. We also set the first state-of-the-art for two large-scale mobile mapping benchmarks: KITTI-360 and DALES.

Crucially, the detected points need to be consistent between views, i.e., correspond to the same 3D point in the scene. One of the main challenges with keypoint detection is the formulation of the learning objective. Previous learning-based methods typically jointly learn descriptors with keypoints, and treat the keypoint detection as a binary classification task on mutual nearest neighbours. However, basing keypoint detection on descriptor nearest neighbours is a proxy task, which is not guaranteed to produce 3D-consistent keypoints. Furthermore, this ties the keypoints to a specific descriptor, complicating downstream usage. In this work, we instead learn keypoints directly from 3D consistency. To this end, we train the detector to detect tracks from large-scale SfM. As these points are often overly sparse, we derive a semi-supervised two-view detection objective to expand this set to a desired number of detections. To train a descriptor, we maximize the mutual nearest neighbour objective over the keypoints with a separate network. Results show that our approach, DeDoDe, achieves significant gains on multiple geometry benchmarks.",https://openreview.net/forum?id=ZrKy10MyR3

We first collect a dataset using visual teleoperation, where the human operator can directly play within a physical simulator to manipulate the articulated objects. We record the data and obtain free and accurate annotations on object poses and contact information from the simulator. Our system only requires an iPhone to record human hand motion, which can be easily scaled up and largely lower the costs of data and annotation collection. With this data, we learn 3D interaction priors including a discriminator (in a GAN) capturing the distribution of how object parts are arranged, and a diffusion model which generates the contact regions on articulated objects, guiding the hand pose estimation. Such structural and contact priors can easily transfer to real-world data with barely any domain gap. By using our data and learned priors, our method significantly improves the performance on joint hand and articulated object poses estimation over the existing state-of-the-art methods.",https://openreview.net/forum?id=NaktXABbkQ

We shift the paradigm away from the classical Non-Rigid Registration methods, which operate under various surface priors, increasing reconstruction fidelity and minimizing required human intervention. Additionally, SPHEAR is a \emph{complete} model that allows not only to sample diverse synthetic head shapes and facial expressions, but also gaze directions, high-resolution color textures, surface normal maps, and hair cuts represented in detail, as strands. SPHEAR can be used for automatic realistic visual data generation, semantic annotation, and general reconstruction tasks.

Hodgins (Meta)","Hair plays a significant role in personal identity and appearance, making it an essential component of high-quality, photorealistic avatars. Existing approaches either focus on modeling the facial region only or rely on personalized models, limiting their generalizability and scalability. In this paper, we present a novel method for creating high-fidelity avatars with diverse hairstyles. Our method leverages the local similarity across different hairstyles and learns a universal hair appearance prior from multi-view captures of hundreds of people. This prior model takes 3D-aligned features as input and generates dense radiance fields conditioned on a sparse point cloud with color. As our model splits different hairstyles into local primitives and builds prior at that level, it is capable of handling various hair topologies. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our model captures a diverse range of hairstyles and generalizes well to challenging new hairstyles. Empirical results show that our method improves the state-of-the-art approaches in capturing and generating photorealistic, personalized avatars with complete hair.",https://openreview.net/forum?id=YMMnd2urj9

Existing work often lacks detailed semantic understanding or uses synthetic datasets, lacking realism and personalization. To address this, we first introduce CloSe-D: a novel large-scale dataset containing 3D clothing segmentation of 3167 scans, covering a range of 18 distinct clothing classes. Additionally, we propose CloSe-Net, the first learning-based 3D clothing segmentation model for fine-grained segmentation from colored point clouds. CloSe-Net uses local point features, body-clothing correlation, and a garment-class and point features-based attention module, improving performance over baselines and prior work. The proposed attention module enables our model to learn appearance and geometry-dependent clothing prior from data. We further validate the efficacy of our approach by successfully segmenting publicly available datasets of people in clothing. We also introduce CloSe-T, a 3D interactive tool for refining segmentation labels. Combining the tool with CloSe-T in a continual learning setup demonstrates improved generalization on real-world data.
