**3DV2021 will take place online!**

Due to the continuing impact and future unpredictability of the COVID-19 pandemic on International travel, 3DV 2021 will be a virtual conference event. This was a difficult  decision, but the safety and well-being of our participants is our utmost priority.  While we understand that a virtual event cannot replicate the experience of a physical meeting, we will work hard to provide a high quality alternative that allows the exchange of our community's latest research and ideas.
