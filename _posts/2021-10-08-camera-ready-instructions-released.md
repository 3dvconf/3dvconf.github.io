**Please review the camera ready instructions when preparing the final version of your paper!**

- [Camera ready instructions can be found here.]({{site.url}}/camera-ready-instructions)

- Please note there is minor error in egpaper_final.tex which adds a page number to the first page.
This can be resolved by uncommenting <code>\thispagestyle{empty}</code> (Line 47 of the original template) and occurs directly after the <code>\maketitle</code> command.
