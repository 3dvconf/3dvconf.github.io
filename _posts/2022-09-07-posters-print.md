The conference **does not** offer poster printing services. 

However, there are shops close to the venue that offer printing services.
Here are some of them, although feel free to reach for another provider.
- [M & P Copier](https://www.mpcopier.cz/): for posters up to A0, less than 10 min walk from the
  venue.
- [AK-ATELIER](https://ak-atelier-spol-s-ro.business.site/): less than 10 min
  walk from the conference venue (the attendant is not english speaking though)
