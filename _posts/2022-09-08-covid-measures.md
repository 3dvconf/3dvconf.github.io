As you are probably aware, some conferences this year have seen a large number
of attendees infected with Covid-19. To reduce the risk of infection, we kindly
ask all attendees to wear a mask when attending the conference. We will provide
extra masks and tests at the registration desk. If you feel sick, please take a
test and only attend the conference in person if you tested negative.
