**Thank you to everyone who participated in 3DV 2021!**


3DV 2021 was held over 3 days with fantastic presentations on the latest 3D Vision research including 4 keynotes, 2 tutorials, 25 oral papers, 105 poster papers and 8 live demos.
The event attracted over 2000 unique participant registrations thanks to our sponsors support allowing us to offer free registration. Thank you to all those who contributed and participated.
Special thanks to the programme chairs, organisers and all those who participated in the paper submission and review process.
We look forward to 3DV 2022 and hopefully seeing you all in person.
