title: Author Guidelines
---

All authors should carefully review the following policies that govern the submission and review process,
as failure to comply with these policies may result in the rejection of your submission as well as possible additional sanctions in the case of dual submissions and plagiarism.
By submitting a paper, the authors agree to the guidelines stipulated in this page.
In addition, authors are urged to consult the [FAQs]({{site.url}}/{{page.year}}/author-faq) as well as the [OpenReview Instructions]({{site.url}}/{{page.year}}/author-instructions).

**Paper Formatting:**
Papers are limited to **eight pages**, including figures and tables, in the 3DV style.
Additional pages containing only cited references are allowed.
Please download the **[3DV 2025 Author Kit](https://3dvconf.github.io/files/2025/author-kit-3DV2025-v1.zip)** for detailed formatting instructions. 
The maximum size of the abstract is 4000 characters.
The paper must be PDF only (maximum 50 MB). Make sure your paper meets the formatting and anonymity requirements described above.
The supplementary material can be either PDF or ZIP only (maximum 200 MB).

Papers that are not properly anonymized, or do not use the template, or have more than eight pages (excluding references) will be rejected without review.

**Submission Process:**
Anyone who plans to submit a paper as an author or a co-author will need to create (or update) their OpenReview profile by the full paper submission deadline.
By submitting a paper to 3DV, the authors agree to the review process and understand that papers are processed by the OpenReview system to match each manuscript to the best possible area chairs and reviewers.

OpenReview author instructions can be found [here]({{site.url}}/{{page.year}}/author-instructions/).

### Supplementary Material Submission
By the supplementary material deadline, the authors may optionally submit code and/or additional material that was ready at the time of paper submission but could not be included due to constraints of format or space.
The authors should refer to the contents of the supplementary material appropriately in the paper. Reviewers will be encouraged to look at it, but are not obligated to do so.

Supplementary material may include videos, proofs, additional figures or tables, more detailed analysis of experiments presented in the paper, code, or a concurrent submission to 3DV or another conference.
It may not include results on additional datasets, results obtained with an improved version of the method (e.g., following additional parameter tuning or training), or an updated or corrected version of the submission PDF. Papers with supplementary materials violating the guidelines may be summarily rejected.

**Code Submission and Reproducibility:**
 To improve reproducibility in AI research, we highly encourage authors to voluntarily submit their code as part of the supplementary material. Authors should also use the [Reproducibility Checklist](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jpineau/ReproducibilityChecklist.pdf) as a guide for writing reproducible papers. Reviewers are encouraged to check the submitted code to ensure that the paper’s results are trustworthy and reproducible. The code should be anonymized, e.g., author names, institutions and licenses should be removed. We do not expect authors to submit private/sensitive data, only data sufficient to demonstrate the method. All code/data will be reviewed confidentially and kept private.

**Detailed supplementary material guidelines:**  
(a) All supplementary material must be self-contained and zipped into a single file. The following document and media formats are allowed: avi, doc, docx, mp4, pdf, wmv.

(b) The paper for review (PDF only) must be submitted first before the supplementary material (PDF or ZIP only) can be submitted. 

(c) Code can be submitted as part of the supplementary zip file or through anonymous Github repositories (include the link in a separate text file in the supplementary zip). The link should point to a branch that will not be modified after the submission deadline.

### Rebuttal

Same as last year, there will be no rebuttal at 3DV 2025.

### Policy

**Submission and Review Process:**
3DV 2025 will be using [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=3DV/2025/Conference) to manage submissions.
Consistent with the review process for previous 3DV conferences, submissions under review will be visible only to their assigned members of the program committee (area chairs, and reviewers). The reviews and author responses will never be made public, and we will not be soliciting comments from the general public during the reviewing process.


**Conflict Responsibilities:**
It is the primary author's responsibility to ensure that all authors on their paper have registered their institutional conflicts into OpenReview.
If a paper is found to have an undeclared or incorrect institutional conflict, the paper may be summarily rejected.
To avoid undeclared conflicts, the author list is considered to be final after the supplementary material deadline and only re-ordering is allowed for accepted papers.

**Double blind review:**
3DV reviewing is double blind, in that authors do not know the names of the area chair/reviewers of their papers, and the area chairs/reviewers cannot, beyond reasonable doubt, infer the names of the authors from the submission and the additional material.
Avoid providing information that may identify the authors in the acknowledgments (e.g., co-workers and grant IDs)
and in the supplemental material (e.g., titles in the movies, or attached papers).
Avoid providing links to websites that identify the authors.
Violation of any of these guidelines may lead to rejection without review.
If you need to cite a different paper of yours that is being submitted concurrently to 3DV, the authors should (1) cite these papers;
(2) argue in the body of your paper why your 3DV paper is non-trivially different from these concurrent submissions;
and (3) include anonymized versions of those papers in the supplemental material.

**Plagiarism:**
Plagiarism consists of appropriating the words or results of another, without credit. 
We will be actively checking for plagiarism.
Furthermore, the paper matching system is quite accurate.
As a result, it regularly happens that a paper containing plagiarized material goes to a reviewer from whom material was plagiarized;
experience shows that such reviewers pursue plagiarism cases enthusiastically.

**Dual/Double Submissions:**
The goals of 3DV are to publish exciting new work for the first time and to avoid duplicating the effort of reviewers.
  
- By submitting a manuscript to 3DV, authors acknowledge that it has not been previously published or accepted for publication in substantially similar form in any peer-reviewed venue including journal, conference or workshop, or archival forum. Furthermore, no publication substantially similar in content has been or will be submitted to this or another conference, workshop, or journal during the review period. Violation of any of these conditions will lead to rejection and will be reported to the other venue to which the submission was sent.

- A publication, for the purposes of this policy, is defined to be a written work longer than four pages (excluding references) that was submitted for review by peers for either acceptance or rejection, and, after review, was accepted. In particular, this definition of publication does not depend upon whether such an accepted written work appears in a formal proceedings or whether the organizers declare that such work “counts as a publication”.

- The above definition does not consider an arXiv.org paper as a publication because it cannot be rejected. It also excludes university technical reports which are typically not peer reviewed. However, this definition of publication does include peer-reviewed workshop papers, even if they do not appear in a proceedings, if their length is more than four pages (excluding citations). Given this definition, any submission to 3DV should not have substantial overlap with prior publications or other concurrent submissions.

- A submission with substantial overlap is one that shares 20 percent or more material with previous or concurrently submitted publications. Authors are encouraged to contact the Program Chairs ( **3dv-2025- pcs [at] googlegroups [dot] com**) about clarifications on borderline cases.

- _Note that a technical report (departmental, arXiv.org, etc.) version of the submission that is put up without any form of direct peer-review is NOT considered published and can be submitted to 3DV 2025._

**Attendance responsibilities:** The authors agree that if the paper is accepted, at least one of the authors will register for the conference and present the paper there.

**Publication:** All accepted papers will be made publicly available. Authors wishing to submit a patent understand that the paper's official public disclosure is one week before the conference or whenever the authors make it publicly available, whichever is first. The conference considers papers confidential until published one week before the conferences, but notes that multiple organizations will have access during the review and production processes, so those seeking patents should discuss filing dates with their IP council. The conference assumes no liability for early disclosures.


**Publicity, social media:** 
The social media policies are consistent with CVPR'25. In particular, 
authors will be allowed to post to social media about their papers in submission. However, until the final accept/reject decisions are released by the conference, posts to social media must not identify the conference name. Violations may result in the paper being rejected or removed from the conference and proceedings.
