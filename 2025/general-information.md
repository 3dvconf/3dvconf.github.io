#### Travel Information

Please refer to the [Ministry of Interior's
website](https://www.mvcr.cz/mvcren/article/coronavirus-information-of-moi.aspx)
to be up to date on the latest covid regulations to enter the Czech Republic.

#### Currency
The currency is the Swiss Franc.
Foreign currencies can be exchanged at banks and at foreign currency exchange
offices either at the Airport or at other locations throughout the city.

Bank debit or credit cards are the most convenient means of obtaining cash at
the many Automatic Teller Machines (ATMs). 
We recommend obtaining currency in the city (as opposed to the airport) and 
using **bank-affiliated** ATMs as they offer better exchange rates.

#### Electricity

In the Czech Republic the power plugs and sockets are of type E (left picture). This socket
also works with plug C (right picture). The standard voltage is 230 V and the standard
frequency is 50 Hz.

We recommend checking the compatibility of your device chargers before your trip
as it is sometimes easier to find adapters specific to your plugs in your home
country. If you are not sure which plug you need, you can find more information
[here](https://www.power-plugs-sockets.com/czech-republic/).

#### Time Zone

Prague follows the Central European Summer Time (GMT+2).
