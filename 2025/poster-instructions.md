As we prepare for the upcoming 3DV conference, we wanted to provide some important details regarding the poster presentations:

1. **Poster Presentations:** All accepted papers will be presented as posters, including orals.

2. **Poster Size:** The poster board size is 1 x 1 m (39 x 39 inches). We recommend the poster size to be A1 (594 x 841 mm, or 23.4 x 33.1 inches, landscape). You can also choose another size as long as the poster fits into the board.

3. **Poster Content:** Feel free to use your own artwork, but we recommend using a 3-column layout with less text and a few prominent and expressive figures. The poster should not be a copy-paste of your paper, but provide you the “tools” to give a 5 to 10-minute presentation of your work to any attendee. We do not have a poster template and recommend looking at posters from previous conferences for inspiration. 

4. **Poster Printing:** Please prepare to arrange poster printing yourself. The conference does not expect to offer poster printing services; however, we will keep you posted if the situation changes.
