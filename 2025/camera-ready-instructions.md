title: Instructions for Camera-Ready Submission
---

Please read these instructions carefully and follow them to minimize delays with the finalization of the conference proceedings.
If you have questions about the camera-ready, please contact the <a href="mailto:3dv25pubchair@googlegroups.com">publication chair</a>. 

All 3DV papers that are submitted on time, which are compliant with the guidelines, and for which have at least one author registered with a full passport registration by the camera-ready deadline will be placed in the conference proceedings.

There are multiple steps to completing your final 3DV 2025 paper submission:

<ol>
 <li>Register at least one author</li>
 <li>Prepare your paper</li>
 <li>Prepare your supplementary material (optional)</li>
 <li>Submit the paper on OpenReview</li>
</ol>

<h2>1. Register at least one author</h2>

Deadline: February 10, 2025

All papers will require one author to pay the <b>Full Passport</b> registration fee to attend the live interactive presentations.
At least one author for each paper must register to attend the conference using our <a href="https://3dvconf.github.io/2025/registration/">online registration</a>.
Provide your paper ID at registration time so that your paper can be matched with your co-authors.
Please note that we will require one registration for each paper in case of authors of multiple papers.
<b>It is not possible for a single person to register multiple papers</b>.
If a paper has no registered authors for the conference, the paper will not be included in the proceedings.

<h2>2. Prepare your paper</h2>

Deadline: February 10, 2025

There is a strict size limit of <b>50 MB</b> for the paper in the conference proceedings. If the size of your paper is bigger than this, you are probably using very large images in your figures. As a rule of thumb, your images will look fine at 600 pixels per inch and you should down-sample the images used in your figures accordingly. 
The page limit for all papers is <b>8</b> pages — with at most <b>4</b> additional pages allowed that contain only cited references.
To clarify, the main body of the paper, including figures, tables, equations, acknowledgments, etc., must be limited to <b>no more than 8 pages</b>. Additional pages may only contain cited references — no acknowledgments or other text, figures, tables, etc. Papers longer than 8 pages (not including references), will not be processed and will not appear in the conference proceedings.

LaTeX style files compatible with the publisher's requirements are available through the <a href="https://3dvconf.github.io/2025/author-guidelines/">3DV 2025 website</a>.

<ul>
<li>Ensure that the paper is formatted according to the final paper submission template (main.tex in CAMERA-READY version).</li>
<li>IMPORTANT NOTE: Do not include page numbers in your camera-ready paper. </li>
<li>The author list is considered to be final after the submission deadline. No authors can be added or removed in the final submission. Authors may be reordered.</li>
</ul>

A note regarding title capitalization: there are several websites that can help ensure proper title capitalization. One site that uses word context to handle the special cases is <a href="https://titlecaseconverter.com/">https://titlecaseconverter.com</a> (be sure to select “AP” style and the “Keep Words in All Caps” option to keep capitalized acronyms). Please ensure that your camera-ready paper also uses the proper capitalization.

<h2>3. Prepare your supplementary material (optional)</h2>

Deadline: February 10, 2025

Supplementary materials can also be uploaded and may include videos, code, images, proofs, additional figures and tables, and a more detailed analysis of experiments presented in the paper. Multiple files must be packed into a single zip file. <b>The file size limit for supplemental materials is 200MB.</b> To save space, videos and code can also be uploaded to YouTube or GitHub.


<h2>4. Submit the paper on OpenReview</h2>

Deadline: February 10, 2025

If you correctly follow the steps above, you may upload your paper and supplementary materials to OpenReview, and your camera-ready submission is considered complete. Congratulations!
