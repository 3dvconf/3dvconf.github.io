We invite submissions to the 12th International Conference on 3D Vision (3DV) 2025, which will be held in Singapore, on **March 25-28, 2025**. Since 2013, under the name 3DV, this event has been a platform for disseminating research results covering a broad variety of topics in 3D computer vision and graphics, from novel optical sensors, signal processing, geometric modeling, representations, to reconstruction, visualization, analysis, rendering, interaction, and a variety of applications.
