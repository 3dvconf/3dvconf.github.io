We invite submissions to the 11th International Conference on 3D Vision (3DaVos 2024), which will be held in Davos, Switzerland, on March 18-21, 2024. Since 2013, under the name 3DV, this event provides a platform for disseminating research results covering a broad variety of topics in the area of 3D computer vision and graphics, from novel optical sensors, signal processing, geometric modeling, representations, to visualization, analysis, interaction, and a variety of applications.

<i>We intend to follow the ECCV’22 approach and only present papers on-site when at least one of the authors is on-site to present the paper.

3DV 2024 will showcase high-quality single-track oral and poster presentations and demonstration sessions. It will also feature industrial exhibitions held in conjunction with the main conference. Proposals for Workshops and Tutorials are also invited.
