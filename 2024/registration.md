If no author is on-site, the paper will not be presented at the conference.
We require every paper to have an in-person presenter, and the publication will be removed from the proceedings otherwise.
In case of visa denial, authors are still required to register for the conference to ensure inclusion in the proceedings.
If the presenter cannot attend due to denied Visa, please collect the supporting evidence, and inform the publication chair.
