title: Author Guidelines
---

All authors should carefully review the following policies that govern the submission and review process,
as failure to comply with these policies may result in the rejection of your submission as well as possible additional sanctions in the case of dual submissions and plagiarism.
By submitting a paper, the authors agree to the [policies stipulated in this website]({{site.url}}/{{page.year}}/policies).
In addition, authors are urged to consult the [FAQs]({{site.url}}/{{page.year}}/author-faq) as well as the [OpenReview Instructions]({{site.url}}/{{page.year}}/author-instructions).

**Paper Formatting:**
Papers are limited to **eight pages**, including figures and tables, in the 3DV style.
Additional pages containing only cited references are allowed.
Please download the **[3DV 2024 Author Kit](https://github.com/cvpr-org/author-kit/releases?q=3DV2024&expanded=true)** for detailed formatting instructions. 
The maximum size of the abstract is 4000 characters.
The paper must be PDF only (maximum 30 MB). Make sure your paper meets the formatting and anonymity requirements described above.
The supplementary material can be either PDF or ZIP only (maximum 100 MB).

Papers that are not properly anonymized, or do not use the template, or have more than eight pages (excluding references) will be rejected without review.

**Submission Process:**
Anyone who plans to submit a paper as an author or a co-author will need to create (or update) their OpenReview profile by the full paper submission deadline.
By submitting a paper to 3DV, the authors agree to the review process and understand that papers are processed by the OpenReview system to match each manuscript to the best possible area chairs and reviewers.

OpenReview author instructions can be found [here]({{site.url}}/{{page.year}}/author-instructions/).

### Supplementary Material Submission
By the supplementary material deadline, the authors may optionally submit code and/or additional material that was ready at the time of paper submission but could not be included due to constraints of format or space.
The authors should refer to the contents of the supplementary material appropriately in the paper. Reviewers will be encouraged to look at it, but are not obligated to do so.

Supplementary material may include videos, proofs, additional figures or tables, more detailed analysis of experiments presented in the paper, code, or a concurrent submission to 3DV or another conference.
It may not include results on additional datasets, results obtained with an improved version of the method (e.g., following additional parameter tuning or training), or an updated or corrected version of the submission PDF. Papers with supplementary materials violating the guidelines may be summarily rejected.

**Code Submission and Reproducibility:**
 To improve reproducibility in AI research, we highly encourage authors to voluntarily submit their code as part of the supplementary material. Authors should also use the [Reproducibility Checklist](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jpineau/ReproducibilityChecklist.pdf) as a guide for writing reproducible papers. Reviewers are encouraged to check the submitted code to ensure that the paperâ€™s results are trustworthy and reproducible. The code should be anonymized, e.g., author names, institutions and licenses should be removed. We do not expect authors to submit private/sensitive data, only data sufficient to demonstrate the method. All code/data will be reviewed confidentially and kept private.

**Detailed supplementary material guidelines:**  
(a) All supplementary material must be self-contained and zipped into a single file. The following document and media formats are allowed: avi, doc, docx, mp4, pdf, wmv.

(b) The paper for review (PDF only) must be submitted first before the supplementary material (PDF or ZIP only) can be submitted. 

(c) Code can be submitted as part of the supplementary zip file or through anonymous Github repositories (include the link in a separate text file in the supplementary zip). The link should point to a branch that will not be modified after the submission deadline.

### Rebuttal

Unlike previous years, there will be no rebuttal at 3DV 2024.

<!--
After receiving the reviews, the authors may optionally submit a rebuttal to address the reviewers' comments.
The rebuttal is limited to a one page PDF file using the rebuttal template included in the [3DV Author Kit](https://github.com/cvpr-org/author-kit/archive/refs/tags/3DV2024-v1.1.zip).

The author rebuttal is optional and is meant to provide you with an opportunity to rebut factual errors or to supply additional information requested by the reviewers.
It is NOT intended to add new contributions (theorems, algorithms, experiments) that were absent in the original submission and NOT specifically requested by the reviewers.
You may optionally add a figure, graph or proof to your rebuttal to better illustrate your answer to the reviewers' comments.

Responses longer than one page will simply not be reviewed.
This includes responses where the margins and formatting are deemed to have been significantly altered from those specified by the style guide.

The rebuttal must maintain anonymity and cannot include external links that reveal the author identity or circumvent the length restriction.

Reviewers should refrain from requesting significant additional experiments for the rebuttal,
or penalize for lack of additional experiments.
Authors should refrain from including new contributions or experimental results in the rebuttal, especially when not specifically requested to do so by the reviewers.
Reviewers are instructed to disregard any such contributions.

Authors also have the possibility to submit a separate confidential comment to the area chair.
Please do so only in exceptional circumstances. -->
