title: Call for Research Demos
---

The International Conference on 3D Vision (3DV) 2024 will be held in Davos, Switzerland, on March 18-21, 2024.
The event will provide a premier platform for disseminating research results covering a broad variety of topics
in the area of 3D research in computer vision and graphics, from novel optical sensors, signal processing,
geometric modeling, representation and transmission, to visualization and interaction, and a variety of applications.


Research demos concern proofs-of-concept, early implementations, and prototypes.
Proposals will be selected based on originality, technical merits, and the ability
to provide attendees with an effective interactive experience. In particular, we regard
as most valuable those demos allowing attendees to freely use the system on their own.


Accepted demos will be presented in person and showcased in a dedicated session.


## Submission
Prepare a one-page summary (letter/A4 size) that describes the demo presentation,
including pictures and, possibly, a link to a video. A PDF file of the one-page summary
should be sent to demo chairs via e-mail: **3DV24-demos [at] googlegroups [dot] com** by
**January 23, 2024**.

## Best Demo Award
Entries are judged by a panel of 3D computer vision experts from across academia and industry.
The jury will select the Best Demo of 3DV 2024.

For any questions, please contact the demo chairs: 3DV24-demos [at] googlegroups [dot] com
