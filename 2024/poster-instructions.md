As we prepare for the upcoming 3DV conference, we wanted to provide some important details regarding the poster presentations:

1. **Poster Presentations:** All accepted papers will be presented as posters, including orals and spotlights.

2. **Enumeration of Poster Boards:** We will have a total of 30 poster boards available for each session. To streamline the setup process and ensure smooth navigation during the event, we will assign a unique number to each board. This will assist presenters in locating their designated display area promptly.
3. **Ideal Poster Size:** The perfect size for the poster boards is AO, (841 x 1189 mm, landscape). This size offers ample space for presenters to showcase their work effectively. If any adjustments or accommodations are needed regarding the posters, please let us know at your earliest convenience.
4. **Attachment Method:** For the convenience of all presenters, we will be providing Tessa powerstrips for the attachment of posters to the boards.
We kindly request that all presenters utilize these provided powerstrips for hanging their posters.

Should you have any questions or require further assistance regarding the poster session setup, please do not hesitate to reach out to us. We are here to ensure a successful and enjoyable event for all participants.

<!-- Each poster will have its own poster board. Please refer to the image below with
diagrams for the possible maximum dimensions of a poster. 

The poster board has two panels that can be used for display. It is possible to
use a single panel for a portrait poster or both panels for either a portrait
or landscape poster. 

The maximum dimensions for a **single panel** poster (portrait only) are 800 mm in
width x 1050 mm in height, which is marked in **<span style="color: #0BDA51">green</span>** in the image. 

The maximum dimensions for a **two-panel poster** (accommodates portrait and
landscape) are 1650 mm in width x 1050 mm in height, which is marked **<span style="color: #DC143C">red</span>**
in the image. One poster can span both panels.

Magnets and two-sided tape will be provided so that you can affix your poster
to the poster board. Your paper is assigned a poster id 
(see [list]({{site.url}}/{{page.year}}/accepted-papers)), which
locates your poster board in one of the three poster halls: A, B, or C (see
[map]({{site.url}}/{{page.year}}/venue)).
The poster id will be labeled on the poster board.
