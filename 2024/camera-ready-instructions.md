Please read these instructions carefully and follow them to minimize delays with the finalization of the conference proceedings.
If you have questions about the camera-ready, please contact the <a href="mailto:3DV24-publication@googlegroups.com">publication chair</a>. 

Please note that deadlines will not be extended, and papers received after the deadline <i>will not appear</i> in the conference proceedings.

All 3DV papers that are submitted on time, which are compliant with the guidelines, and for which the copyright form has been completed and have at least one author registered with a full passport registration by the camera-ready deadline will be placed in the conference proceedings.

There are multiple steps to completing your final 3DV 2024 paper submission:

<ol>
 <li>Register at least one author (Dec 10, 2023 23:59 PST)</li>
 <li>Prepare your paper (Dec 10, 2023 23:59 PST)</li>
 <li>Prepare your supplementary material (optional)</li>
 <li>Validate your camera-ready paper</li>
 <li>Complete and submit the Electronic Copyright Form</li>
 <li>Submit the validated paper</li>
</ol>

<h2>1. Register at least one author</h2>

Deadline: (Dec 10, 2023 23:59 PST)

All papers will require one author to pay the <b>Full Passport</b> registration fee (not Student) to attend the live interactive presentations. At least one author for each paper must register to attend the conference using our <a href="https://3dvconf.github.io/2024/registration/">online registration</a>.
Provide your paper ID at registration time so that your paper can be matched with your co-authors. Please note that we will require one Passport fee for each paper in case of authors of multiple papers. <b>It is not possible to register multiple papers for a single person</b>. If a paper has no registered authors for the conference, the paper will not be included in the proceedings.

<h2>2. Prepare your paper</h2>

Deadline: (Dec 10, 2023 23:59 PST)

There is a strict size limit of <b>30 MB</b> for the paper in the conference proceedings. If the size of your paper is bigger than this, you are probably using very large images in your figures. As a rule of thumb, your images will look fine at 600 pixels per inch and you should down-sample the images used in your figures accordingly. 
The page limit for all papers is 8 pages—with at most 4 additional pages allowed that contain only cited references. To clarify, the main body of the paper, including figures, tables, equations, acknowledgments, etc., must be limited to <b>no more than 8 pages</b>. Additional pages may only contain cited references—not acknowledgments or other text, figures, tables, etc. Papers longer than 8 pages (not including references), will not be processed and will not appear in the conference proceedings.

LaTeX style files compatible with the publisher's requirements are available through the <a href="https://github.com/cvpr-org/author-kit/archive/refs/tags/3DV2024-v1.2.zip">3DV 2024 website (zip)</a>.

<ul>
<li>Ensure that the paper is formatted according to the final paper submission template (main.tex in CAMERA-READY version).</li>
<li>IMPORTANT NOTE: Do not include page numbers in your camera-ready paper. </li>
<li>The author list is considered to be final after the submission deadline. No authors can be added to the final submission.</li>
</ul>

A note regarding title capitalization: there are several websites that can help ensure proper title capitalization. One site that uses word context to handle the special cases is <a href="https://titlecaseconverter.com/">https://titlecaseconverter.com</a> (be sure to select “AP” style and the “Keep Words in All Caps” option to keep capitalized acronyms). Please ensure that your camera-ready paper also uses the proper capitalization.

<h2>3. Prepare your supplementary material (optional)</h2>

Deadline: (Dec 10, 2023 23:59 PST)

Supplementary material can also be uploaded. The supplementary material may include videos, images, proofs, additional figures or tables, a more detailed analysis of experiments presented in the paper, or code.

The uploaded supplemental material may only include PDF files. For videos, we suggest uploading them somewhere, e.g., YouTube, and then providing a link to the video in the supplementary PDF. Multiple files can be packed in a zip file. <b>The file size limit for supplemental material is 100MB</b>.
