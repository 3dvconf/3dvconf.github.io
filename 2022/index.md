The 10th International Conference on 3D Vision will be held **in Prague, Czechia** on **September 12-16, 2022**.
The event will be hybrid, with both in-person and virtual attendance options.

In 2011, 3DIM and 3DPVT joined forces to create a new yearly conference dedicated to 3D research, originally known as 3DIMPVT for 2011 and 2012. Since 2013, under the name 3DV (3D Vision). 
This event has provided a premier platform for disseminating research results covering a broad variety of topics in the area of 3D research in computer vision and graphics, from novel optical sensors, signal processing, geometric modelling, representation and transmission, to visualization and interaction, and a variety of applications.
