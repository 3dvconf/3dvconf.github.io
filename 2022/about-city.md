title: Welcome to Prague!
---

Located in the heart of Europe, the city of Prague is an open-air museum on its
own you will love strolling through.
The city is a kaleidoscope of architectural styles and its incredible
historical center, which is part of the Unesco World Heritage collection, will
feel like a travel to the past centuries. The capital of the Czech Republic
also has numerous green havens that will make you forget you are even in a
city.  


### Useful links

**Transportation** Prague benefits from an incredible network of undergrounds
and trams running frequently and through the night. A useful way to get around
the city is to download the official transportation app where you can plan
trips and buy tickets [PID Litacka](https://app.pidlitacka.cz/).  Tickets
within Prague are constrained by time ([check here for
fares](https://pid.cz/en/travelling-around-prague/?tab=1)). You can also buy
tickets at metro stations and on some of the trams (only with contactless cards
for tram).
