**Authors**

At least one of the authors needs to be registered by either the Passport
Registration (Full) or the Passport Registration (Student) by the time of the
camera ready deadline. 
It is **not** possible to register multiple papers for a single person. 

Presenting authors can present their work virtually but they still need to
proceed with Passport registration.
**Virtual registrations will not cover a paper submission**. If circumstances
prevent you from attending in person to present your paper, you may attend
virtually but you must register and pay for your paper under a passport
registration. During registration you will have an opportunity to select that
you will attend virtually.
