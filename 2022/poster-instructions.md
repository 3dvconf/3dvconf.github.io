Each poster will have its own poster board. Please refer to the image below with
diagrams for the possible maximum dimensions of a poster. 

The poster board has two panels that can be used for display. It is possible to
use a single panel for a portrait poster or both panels for either a portrait
or landscape poster. 

The maximum dimensions for a **single panel** poster (portrait only) are 800 mm in
width x 1050 mm in height, which is marked in **<span style="color: #0BDA51">green</span>** in the image. 

The maximum dimensions for a **two-panel poster** (accommodates portrait and
landscape) are 1650 mm in width x 1050 mm in height, which is marked **<span style="color: #DC143C">red</span>**
in the image. One poster can span both panels.

Magnets and two-sided tape will be provided so that you can affix your poster
to the poster board. Your paper is assigned a poster id 
(see [list]({{site.url}}/{{page.year}}/accepted-papers)), which
locates your poster board in one of the three poster halls: A, B, or C (see
[map]({{site.url}}/{{page.year}}/venue)).
The poster id will be labeled on the poster board.

although feel free to reach for another provider.
