title: Call for Research Demos
---

The 10th International Conference on 3D Vision will be held in hybrid format on
September 12-15, 2022. This event will provide a premier platform for disseminating
research results covering a broad variety of topics in the area of 3D research in
computer vision and graphics, from novel optical sensors, signal processing, geometric
modeling, representation and transmission, to visualization and interaction, and a
variety of applications.

Research demos concern proofs-of-concept, early implementations, and prototypes.
Proposals will be selected based on originality, technical merits, and the ability to
provide attendees with an effective interactive experience. In particular, we regard as
most valuable those demos allowing attendees to freely use the system on their own.

3DV2022 is planned to be hybrid so in-person and online demo sessions are welcome.
Accepted demos presented in person will be showcased in a dedicated session
alongside poster presentations. For online demos, we will provide a virtual room where
you can use a live camera to interactively show your demo during the live sessions.

All accepted demos are also requested to submit a 5-minute close-captioned demo
video that will be shown outside the live sessions.

## Submission
Prepare a one-page summary (letter/A4 size) that describes the demo presentation,
including pictures and, possibly, a link to a video. A PDF file of the one-page summary
should be sent to demo chairs via e-mail: **3DV22-demos [at] googlegroups [dot] com** by
**August 15, 2022**.

## Best Demo Award

Entries are judged by a panel of 3D computer vision experts from across academia and
the industry. The jury will select the best demonstration of 3DV 2022. The Best Demo
winner will receive a prize.

For any questions, please contact the demo chairs: 3DV22-demos [at] googlegroups [dot] com
