**Review Process:** By submitting a paper to 3DV, the authors agree to the review process and understand that papers are processed by the Toronto system to match each manuscript to the best possible area chairs and reviewers.
<br><br>

**Confidentiality:** The review process of 3DV is confidential. Reviewers are volunteers, not part of the 3DV organization, and their efforts are greatly appreciated. The practice of keeping all information confidential during the review is part of the standard communication to all reviewers. Misuse of confidential information is a severe professional failure and appropriate measures will be taken when brought to the attention of the 3DV organizers. It should be noted, however, that the organization of 3DV is not and cannot be held responsible for the consequences when reviewers break confidentiality.
<br><br>

**Conflict Responsibilities:** It is the primary author's responsibility to ensure that all authors on their paper have registered their institutional conflicts into CMT3 (see details under Domain Conflicts below). If a paper is found to have an undeclared or incorrect institutional conflict, the paper may be summarily rejected. To avoid undeclared conflicts, the author list is considered to be final after the submission deadline and no changes are allowed for accepted papers.
<br><br>

**Double blind review:** 3DV reviewing is double blind, in that authors do not know the names of the area chair/reviewers of their papers, and the area chairs/reviewers cannot, beyond reasonable doubt, infer the names of the authors from the submission and the additional material. Avoid providing information that may identify the authors in the acknowledgments (e.g., co-workers and grant IDs) and in the supplemental material (e.g., titles in the movies, or attached papers). Avoid providing links to websites that identify the authors. Violation of any of these guidelines may lead to rejection without review. If you need to cite a different paper of yours that is being submitted concurrently to 3DV, the authors should (1) cite these papers; (2) argue in the body of your paper why your 3DV paper is non-trivially different from these concurrent submissions; and (3) include anonymized versions of those papers in the supplemental material.
<br><br>

**Plagiarism:** Plagiarism consists of appropriating the words or results of another, without credit. 3DV 2022's policy on plagiarism is to refer suspected cases to the IEEE Intellectual Property office, which has an established mechanism for dealing with plagiarism and wide powers of excluding offending authors from future conferences and from IEEE journals. You can find information on this office, their procedures, and their definitions of five levels of plagiarism at this webpage. We will be actively checking for plagiarism. Furthermore, the paper matching system is quite accurate. As a result, it regularly happens that a paper containing plagiarized material goes to a reviewer from whom material was plagiarized; experience shows that such reviewers pursue plagiarism cases enthusiastically.
<br><br>

**Dual/Double Submissions:** The goals of 3DV are to publish exciting new work for the first time and to avoid duplicating the effort of reviewers.
<br>

- By submitting a manuscript to 3DV, authors acknowledge that it has not been previously published or accepted for publication in substantially similar form in any peer-reviewed venue including journal, conference or workshop, or archival forum. Furthermore, no publication substantially similar in content has been or will be submitted to this or another conference, workshop, or journal during the review period. Violation of any of these conditions will lead to rejection and will be reported to the other venue to which the submission was sent.
<br>

- A publication, for the purposes of this policy, is defined to be a written work longer than four pages (excluding references) that was submitted for review by peers for either acceptance or rejection, and, after review, was accepted. In particular, this definition of publication does not depend upon whether such an accepted written work appears in a formal proceedings or whether the organizers declare that such work “counts as a publication”.
<br><br>

- The above definition does not consider an arXiv.org paper as a publication because it cannot be rejected. It also excludes university technical reports which are typically not peer reviewed. However, this definition of publication does include peer-reviewed workshop papers, even if they do not appear in a proceedings, if their length is more than four pages (excluding citations). Given this definition, any submission to 3DV should not have substantial overlap with prior publications or other concurrent submissions.
<br>

- A submission with substantial overlap is one that shares 20 percent or more material with previous or concurrently submitted publications. Authors are encouraged to contact the Program Chairs ( **TBD**) about clarifications on borderline cases.
<br>

- _Note that a technical report (departmental, arXiv.org, etc.) version of the submission that is put up without any form of direct peer-review is NOT considered prior art and should NOT be cited in the submission._
<br><br>


**Attendance responsibilities:** The authors agree that if the paper is accepted, at least one of the authors will register for the conference and present the paper there.
<br><br>

**Publication:** All accepted papers will be made publicly available. Authors wishing to submit a patent understand that the paper's official public disclosure is one week before the conference or whenever the authors make it publicly available, whichever is first. The conference considers papers confidential until published one week before the conferences, but notes that multiple organizations will have access during the review and production processes, so those seeking patents should discuss filing dates with their IP council. The conference assumes no liability for early disclosures.
