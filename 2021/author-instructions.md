### CMT submissions Website

**CMT Site:** <a target="_blank" href="http://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/3DV2021">http://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/3DV2021</a>



### Submission Guidelines

All submissions will be handled electronically via the conference's CMT website. By submitting a paper, the authors agree to the [policies stipulated in this website]({{site.url}}/policies). The paper registration deadline is **July 23, 2021**, and the submission deadline is **July 30, 2021**. Supplementary material can be submitted until **August 8, 2021**. 
Note that unless the authors cannot submit a paper without its registration.

Papers are limited to eight pages, including figures and tables, in the 3DV style. Additional pages containing only cited references are allowed. Please refer to the following files for detailed formatting instructions:
- **[Download Author Kit]({{site.url}}/files/2021/3DV2021AuthorKit.zip)**

Papers that are not properly anonymized, or do not use the template, or have more than eight pages (excluding references) will be rejected without review.

**1) Paper submission and review site:**

Submission Site (bookmark or save this URL!)

Please make sure that your browser has cookies and Javascript enabled.

Please add "email@msr-cmt.org" to your list of safe senders (whitelist) to prevent important email announcements from being blocked by spam filters.

Log into CMT3 at [https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com). If you do not see “International Conference on 3D Vision 2021” in the conference list already, click on the “All Conferences” tab and find it there.


**2) Setting up your profile:** 

You can update your User Profile, Email, and Password by clicking on your name in the upper-right inside the Author Console and choosing the appropriate option under “General”.

**3) Domain Conflicts:** 

When you log in for the first time, you will be asked to enter your conflict domain information. You will not be able to submit any paper without entering this information. We need to ensure conflict-free reviewing of all papers. At any time before the submission deadline, you can update this information by clicking on your name in the upper-right and entering “Domain Conflicts” under 3DV 2021.

It is the primary author's responsibility to ensure that all authors on their paper have registered their institutional conflicts into CMT3. Each author should list domains of all institutions they have worked for, or have had very close collaboration with, within the last three years (example: mit.edu; ox.ac.uk; microsoft.com). DO NOT enter the domain of email providers such as gmail.com. This institutional conflict information will be used in conjunction with prior authorship conflict information to resolve assignments to both reviewers and area chairs. If a paper is found to have an undeclared or incorrect institutional conflict, the paper may be summarily rejected.

**4) Creating a paper submission:**

 This step must be completed by the paper registration deadline. After this deadline, you will not be able to register new papers, but you will be able to edit the information for existing papers.

(a) Click the “+ Create new submission” button in the upper-left to create a new submission. There, you will be prompted to enter the title, abstract, authors, and subject areas. You are strongly encouraged to finalize the author list by the registration deadline.

(b) Check with your co-authors to make sure that: (1) you add them with their correct CMT3 email; and (2) they have entered their domain conflicts into CMT3 for 3DV 2021. If you add an author with an email that is not in CMT3 and the name and organization is not automatically filled, that means they are not yet in the system, and you should make sure to check that they do not already have an account under a different email before completing the requested information to add them.

(c) Enter subject (topic) areas for your paper. You must include at least one primary area. This information is used to help assign ACs and reviewers.

**5) Paper Number**

Once you have registered your paper (i.e. title/authors), you will be assigned a paper number. Insert this into the latex or word template before generating the pdf of your paper for submission. Papers submitted without a number may not be reviewed.

**6) Submission Requirements:**

The maximum size of the abstract is 4000 characters.

The paper must be PDF only (maximum 100MB). Make sure your paper meets the formatting and anonymity requirements described above.

The supplementary material can be either PDF or ZIP only (maximum 100MB).

**7) Supplementary Material Submission:**

By the supplementary material deadline, the authors may optionally submit code and/or additional material that was ready at the time of paper submission but could not be included due to constraints of format or space. The authors should refer to the contents of the supplementary material appropriately in the paper. Reviewers will be encouraged to look at it but are not obligated to do so.

Supplementary material may include videos, proofs, additional figures or tables, more detailed analysis of experiments presented in the paper, code, or a concurrent submission to 3DV or another conference. It may not include results on additional datasets, results obtained with an improved version of the method (e.g., following additional parameter tuning or training), or an updated or corrected version of the submission PDF. Papers with supplementary materials violating the guidelines may be summarily rejected.

**8) Code Submission and Reproducibility:**

 To improve reproducibility in AI research, we highly encourage authors to voluntarily submit their code as part of the supplementary material. Authors should also use the [Reproducibility Checklist](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jpineau/ReproducibilityChecklist.pdf) as a guide for writing reproducible papers. Reviewers are encouraged to check the submitted code to ensure that the paper’s results are trustworthy and reproducible. The code should be anonymized, e.g., author names, institutions and licenses should be removed. We do not expect authors to submit private/sensitive data, only data sufficient to demonstrate the method. All code/data will be reviewed confidentially and kept private.

 

**Detailed supplementary material guidelines:**

(a) All supplementary material must be self-contained and zipped into a single file. The following document and media formats are allowed: avi, doc, docx, mp4, pdf, wmv. CMT imposes a 100MB limit on the size of this file. Note that you can update the file by uploading a new one (the old one will be deleted and replaced).

(b) The paper for review (PDF only) must be submitted first before the supplementary material (PDF or ZIP only) can be submitted. 

(c) Code can be submitted as part of the supplementary zip file or through anonymous Github repositories (include the link in a separate text file in the supplementary zip). The link should point to a branch that will not be modified after the submission deadline.

### Rebuttal Instructions

After receiving the reviews, authors may optionally submit a rebuttal to address the reviewers' comments, which will be limited to a one page PDF file using the 3DV 2021 Rebuttal Template.
- **[Download Rebuttal Kit]({{site.url}}/files/2021/3DV2021RebuttalKit.zip)**

The rebuttal must maintain anonymity and cannot include external links that reveal the author identity or circumvent the length restriction.

Responses longer than one page will simply not be reviewed. This includes responses where the margins and formatting are deemed to have been significantly altered from those specified by the style guide.

The author rebuttal is optional and is meant to provide you with an opportunity to rebut factual errors or to supply additional information requested by the reviewers. It is NOT intended to add new contributions (theorems, algorithms, experiments) that were absent in the original submission and NOT specifically requested by the reviewers. You may optionally add a figure, graph or proof to your rebuttal to better illustrate your answer to the reviewers' comments.

Reviewers should refrain from requesting significant additional experiments for the rebuttal, or penalize for lack of additional experiments. Authors should refrain from including new experimental results in the rebuttal, especially when not specifically requested to do so by the reviewers.
