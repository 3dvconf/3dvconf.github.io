title: Call for Research Demos
---

The 9th International Conference on 3D Vision will be held virtually on December 1-3, 2021. This event will provide a premier platform for disseminating research results covering a broad variety of topics in the area of 3D research in computer vision and graphics, from novel optical sensors, signal processing, geometric modeling, representation and transmission, to visualization and interaction, and a varikety of applications.

Research demos concern proofs-of-concept, early implementations, and prototypes. Proposals will be selected based on originality, technical merits, and the ability to provide attendees with an effective interactive experience. In particular, we regard as most valuable those demos allowing attendees to freely use the system on their own.

As 3DV2021 is held fully online, the research demo sessions will also be held online during the conference. We will provide a virtual room where you can use a live camera to interactively show the demo from your room during the live sessions, and show a demo video outside the live sessions. The detailed schedule will be provided later.

The authors of the accepted research demos will need to:
- submit a narrated video file of the demo for on-demand presentation of maximum 5 min (please use standard encoding format with a maximum of 50MB, or a link to a video)
- optionally make a 10-min live demonstration via online-system in the demo session at 3DV2021 (technical details will be shared upon acceptance)


## Submission
Prepare one page summary (letter/A4 size) that describes the demo presentation, including pictures and, possibly, a link to a video. 
A PDF file of the one page summary should be sent to demo chairs via e-mail: **3DV21-demos [at] 3dv [dot] org**

## Best Demo Award
Entries are judged by a panel of 3D computer vision experts from across academia and the industry. 
The jury will select the best demonstration of 3DV 2021. 
The Best Demo winner will receive a cash prize of **Â£1000** from our sponsor **Ocado Technology**.
