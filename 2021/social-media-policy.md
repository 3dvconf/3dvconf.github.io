The 3DV organizers encourage members and volunteers to use social media to engage with one another and communicate about 3DV activities, publications, and professional development resources. The following guidelines and best practices are intended to assist 3DV organizers, participants and sponsors in effectively promoting 3DV on online platforms intended for users to share and engage with content. 
This policy is based on the [ACM social media policy and best practices](https://authors.acm.org/author-resources/social-media-policy).

## Social Media Policy 

- Content posted on social networks on behalf of 3DV21 should adhere to the expectations of professional and ethical conduct established in the [3DV code of conduct]({{site.url}}/code-of-conduct).  

- Images posted to social networks representing 3DV should either belong to the 3DV conference or publication or be free to use and share. 

- Third-party content should be properly attributed to its original source.  


## Official Account and Hashtag

- [**@3DVConf** on Twitter](https://twitter.com/3DVconf) is the official social media platform for 3DV 2021.

- [**#3DV2021**](https://twitter.com/search?q=%233DV2021&src=typeahead_click&f=live) is the official hashtag for 3DV 2021 - please include this hashtag in all posts related to 3DV 2021.


## Best Practice Guidelines 

- Schedule posts when your audience is most active and likely to engage with your content, and ensure that there is a steady stream of posts from your account. 

- The text of social posts should maintain a conversational and accessible tone while conveying professionalism and a sense of authority on the topic.  

- Visually engaging content is more likely to generate higher engagement, so posts should contain a prominent photo, video or illustration whenever possible.  

- Third-party content (posts not directly related to an 3DV activity, product, or service) should come from reputable and authoritative sources and be of interest to the broader computing community.  

- Posts should include relevant hashtags to increase their exposure and “@mentions” to engage other users who would be interested in their content.  

- Social media content should be viewed as part of a conversation, and posts should aim to generate reactions, comments and engagement.
