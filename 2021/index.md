The 9th International Conference on 3D Vision will be held **Online** on **December 1-3, 2021**. 

In 2011, 3DIM and 3DPVT joined forces to create a new yearly conference dedicated to 3D research, originally known as 3DIMPVT for 2011 and 2012. Since 2013, under the name 3DV (3D Vision). 
This event has provided a premier platform for disseminating research results covering a broad variety of topics in the area of 3D research in computer vision and graphics, from novel optical sensors, signal processing, geometric modelling, representation and transmission, to visualization and interaction, and a variety of applications.

<b>Notice: July 7 2021</b><br/>
Due to the continuing impact and future unpredictability of the COVID-19 pandemic on International travel, 3DV 2021 will be a virtual conference event. This was a difficult  decision, but the safety and well-being of our participants is our utmost priority.  While we understand that a virtual event cannot replicate the experience of a physical meeting, we will work hard to provide a high quality alternative that allows the exchange of our community's latest research and ideas.
