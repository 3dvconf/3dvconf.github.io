We invite submissions to the 9th International Conference on 3D Vision, which will be held in London, UK, and/or virtually on December 01-03, 2021.
Since 2013, under the name 3DV, this event has provided a premier platform for disseminating research results covering a broad variety of topics in the area of 3D computer vision and graphics, from novel optical sensors, signal processing, geometric modelling, representation and transmission, to visualization, analysis, interaction, and a variety of applications.
Â 
3DV 2021 will showcase high quality single-track oral and poster presentations and demonstration sessions. 
It will also feature industrial exhibitions held in conjunction with the main conference. 
Proposals for Tutorials and Demos are also invited.
