### Oral Presentations

Below are some details regarding the oral presentations:

1. **Oral Presentations:** Each oral presentation should be 12 minutes long, with an additional 3 minutes for Q&A.
2. **Format:** The presenter should use their own laptop for the presentation. We will update you if the situation changes.


### Poster Presentations

Below are some details regarding the poster presentations:

1. **Poster Presentations:** All accepted papers will be presented as posters, including orals.

2. **Poster Size:** The poster board size is 1 x 1 m (39 x 39 inches). We recommend the poster size to be A1 (594 x 841 mm, or 23.4 x 33.1 inches, landscape). You can also choose another size as long as the poster fits into the board.

3. **Poster Content:** Feel free to use your own artwork, but we recommend using a 3-column layout with less text and a few prominent and expressive figures. The poster should not be a copy-paste of your paper, but provide you the “tools” to give a 5 to 10-minute presentation of your work to any attendee. We do not have a poster template and recommend looking at posters from previous conferences for inspiration.
