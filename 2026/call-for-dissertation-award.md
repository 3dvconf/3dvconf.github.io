title: Call for Nominations - 3DV Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award
year: 2026
---

For the first time, 3DV 2026 will feature an outstanding doctoral dissertation award to recognize early career researchers working on research topics that fall within the scope of 3DV. In particular, the award aims to honor significant contributions to the areas of 3D computer vision, e.g., in the form of developing groundbreaking algorithms that push the field forward, creating benchmarks that have become a standard in the field, etc.  
The award recipient will be invited to attend the 3DV 2026 conference to receive the award and give a short talk, with 3DV 2026 partially supporting attendance.

### Eligibility
Eligible are doctoral dissertations that were successfully defended during the 3 calendar years prior to 3DV 2026, i.e., researchers who defended their PhD no earlier than January 1st 2023 (the date of the defense, not the date when the title was awarded, is considered). **The dissertation must contain work that has or will be published in at least one 3DV publication.** Papers accepted to 3DV 2026 fulfill this requirement.

### Evaluation
The evaluation will proceed in two stages. In the first stage, the 3DV Dissertation Awards Committee pre-selects a set of nominations and forms a jury such that the members of the jury have no conflict of interest with the nominees. In the second stage, the jury selects the winner of the award.
Key criteria for the jury include, but are not limited to: technical depth, significance of research contribution, potential impact, and quality of presentation. 

### Nomination process
Eligible researchers are nominated by their advisor(s). There is no limit on the number of nominations from any single institution or advisor. Researchers who are not selected for the 2026 award will be eligible in the future as long as they fulfill the eligibility criteria.
