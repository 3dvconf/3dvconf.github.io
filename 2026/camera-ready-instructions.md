title: Instructions for Camera-Ready Submission
---

Please read these instructions carefully and follow them to minimize delays with the finalization of the conference proceedings.
If you have questions about the camera-ready, please contact the <a href="mailto:3dv26-pubchairs@googlegroups.com">publication chairs</a>.

All 3DV papers that are submitted on time, which are compliant with the guidelines, and for which have at least one author registered with a full passport registration by the camera-ready deadline will be placed in the conference proceedings.

There are multiple steps to completing your final 3DV 2026 paper submission:

<ol>
 <li>Register at least one author</li>
 <li>Prepare your paper</li>
 <li>Prepare your supplementary material (optional)</li>
 <li>Submit the paper on OpenReview</li>
 <li>Submit the paper to IEEE</li>
</ol>

<h2>1. Register at least one author</h2>

Deadline: January 20, 2026

All papers will require one author to pay the <b>Full Passport</b> registration fee to attend the live interactive presentations.
At least one author for each paper must register to attend the conference using our <a href="https://3dvconf.github.io/2026/registration/">online registration</a>.
Provide your paper ID at registration time so that your paper can be matched with your co-authors.
Please note that we will require one registration for each paper in case of authors of multiple papers.
<b>It is not possible for a single person to register multiple papers</b>.
If a paper has no registered authors for the conference, the paper will not be included in the proceedings.

<h2>2. Prepare your paper</h2>

Deadline: January 20, 2026

There is a strict size limit of <b>50 MB</b> for the paper in the conference proceedings. If the size of your paper is bigger than this, you are probably using very large images in your figures. As a rule of thumb, your images will look fine at 600 pixels per inch and you should down-sample the images used in your figures accordingly. 
The page limit for all papers is <b>8</b> pages — with at most <b>4</b> additional pages allowed that contain only cited references.
To clarify, the main body of the paper, including figures, tables, equations, acknowledgments, etc., must be limited to <b>no more than 8 pages</b>. Additional pages may only contain cited references — no acknowledgments or other text, figures, tables, etc. Papers longer than 8 pages (not including references), will not be processed or appear in the conference proceedings.

LaTeX style files compatible with the publisher's requirements are available through the <a href="https://3dvconf.github.io/2026/author-guidelines/">3DV 2026 website</a>.

<ul>
<li>Ensure that the paper is formatted according to the final paper submission template (main.tex in CAMERA-READY version).</li>
<li>IMPORTANT NOTE: Do not include page numbers in your camera-ready paper. </li>
<li>The author list is considered to be final after the submission deadline. No authors can be added or removed in the final submission. Authors may be reordered.</li>
</ul>

A note regarding title capitalization: there are several websites that can help ensure proper title capitalization. One site that uses word context to handle the special cases is <a href="https://titlecaseconverter.com/">https://titlecaseconverter.com</a> (be sure to select “AP” style and the “Keep Words in All Caps” option to keep capitalized acronyms). Please ensure that your camera-ready paper also uses the proper capitalization.

<h2>3. Prepare your supplementary material (optional)</h2>

Deadline: January 20, 2026

Supplementary materials can also be uploaded and may include videos, code, images, proofs, additional figures and tables, and a more detailed analysis of experiments presented in the paper. Multiple files must be packed into a single zip file. <b>The file size limit for supplemental materials is 200MB.</b> To save space, videos and code can also be uploaded to YouTube or GitHub.


<h2>4. Submit the paper on OpenReview</h2>

Deadline: January 20, 2026

If you correctly follow the steps above, you may upload your paper and supplementary materials to OpenReview.

<h2>5. Submit the paper to IEEE</h2>

Deadline: January 20, 2026

Please also submit your paper to IEEE via the link that you will receive over email. Note that the IEEE copyright form and pdf checker are now included in the IEEE submission portal. If there are any questions, please contact the <a href="mailto:3dv26-pubchairs@googlegroups.com">publication chairs</a>, as well as the IEEE production editor <a href="mailto:j.gurrola@contractor.ieee.org">Javier Gurrola</a>. Your camera-ready submission is now considered complete. Congratulations!
