We invite submissions to the 13th International Conference on 3D Vision (3DV) 2026, which will be held in Metro Vancouver, BC, Canada, on **March 20-23, 2026**. Since 2013, under the name 3DV, this event has been a platform for disseminating research results covering a broad variety of topics in the area of 3D computer vision and graphics, from novel optical sensors, signal processing, geometric modeling, representations, to reconstruction, visualization, analysis, rendering, interaction, and a variety of applications.


3DV 2026 will showcase high-quality single-track oral and poster presentations. It will also feature industrial exhibitions and mentoring sessions held in conjunction with the main conference. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
