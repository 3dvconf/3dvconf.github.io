title: "PoseContrast: Class-Agnostic Object Viewpoint Estimation in the Wild with Pose-Aware Contrastive Learning"
authors: "Yang Xiao, Yuming Du and Renaud Marlet"
abstract: "Motivated by the need of estimating the 3D pose of arbitrary objects in the wild, we consider the challenging problem of class-agnostic object viewpoint estimation from images only, without CAD model knowledge. The idea is to leverage features learned on seen classes to estimate the pose for classes that are unseen, yet that share similar geometries and canonical frames with seen classes. For this, we train a direct pose estimator in a class-agnostic way by sharing weights across all object classes, and we introduce a contrastive learning method that has three main ingredients: (i)~the use of pre-trained, self-supervised, contrast-based features; (ii)~pose-aware data augmentations; (iii)~a pose-aware contrastive loss. We experimented on Pascal3D+ and ObjectNet3D, as well as Pix3D in a cross-dataset fashion, with both seen and unseen classes. We report state-of-the-art results, including against methods that additionally use CAD models as input."
