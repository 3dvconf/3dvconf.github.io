title: "Neural Human Deformation Transfer"

abstract: "We consider the problem of human deformation transfer,
 where the goal is to retarget poses between different charac-
 ters. Traditional methods that tackle this problem require a
 clear definition of the pose, and use this definition to trans-
 fer poses between characters. In this work, we take a dif-
 ferent approach and transform the identity of a character to
 a new identity without modifying the character’s pose. This
 offers the advantage of not having to define equivalences
 of 3D human poses, which is not straight forward as poses
 tend to change depending on the identity of the character
 performing it, and as their meaning is highly contextual.
 To achieve the deformation transfer, we propose a neural
 encoder-decoder architecture where only identity informa-
 tion is encoded and where the decoder is conditioned on
 the pose. We use pose independent representations, such as
 isometry-invariant shape characteristics, to encode identity
 features. Our model uses these features to predict offsets
 from the deformed pose to the result of the transfer. We
 show experimentally that our method outperforms state of
 the art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively, and
 generalises better to poses not seen during training. We
 also introduce a fine-tuning step that allows to obtain com-
 petitive results for extreme identities, and allows to transfer
 simple clothing."
