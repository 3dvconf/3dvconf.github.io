title: "Exemplar Fine-Tuning for 3D Human Model Fitting Towards In-the-Wild 3D Human Pose Estimation"
authors: "Hanbyul Joo, Natalia Neverova and Andrea Vedaldi"
abstract: "Differently from 2D image datasets such as COCO, large-scale human datasets with 3D ground-truth annotations are very difficult to obtain in the wild. In this paper, we address this problem by augmenting existing 2D datasets with high-quality 3D pose fits. Remarkably, the resulting annotations are sufficient to train from scratch 3D pose regressor networks that outperform the current state-of-the-art on difficult benchmarks such as 3DPW. Additionally, training on our augmented data is straightforward as it does not require to mix multiple and slightly incompatible 2D and 3D datasets or to use complicated network architectures and training procedures. This simplified pipelines affords additional improvements, including injecting extreme crop augmentations to better reconstruct highly truncated people, and incorporating auxiliary inputs to improve 3D pose estimation accuracy. It also reduces the dependency on 3D datasets such as H36M that have restrictive licenses. We also use our method to introduce new benchmarks for the study of real-world challenges such as occlusions, truncations and rare body poses. In order to obtain such high quality 3D pseudo-annotations, inspired by progress in internal learning, we introduce Exemplar Fine-Tuning (EFT). EFT combines the re-projection accuracy of fitting methods like SMPLify with a 3D pose prior implicitly captured by a pre-trained 3D pose regressor network. We show that EFT produces 3D annotations that result in better downstream performance and are qualitatively preferable in an extensive human-based assessment."
