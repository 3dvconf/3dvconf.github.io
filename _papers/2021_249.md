title: "RAFT-Stereo: Multilevel Recurrent Field Transforms for Stereo Matching"
authors: "Lahav O Lipson, Zachary Teed and Jia Deng"
abstract: "We introduce RAFT-Stereo, a new deep architecture for rectified stereo based on the optical flow network RAFT. We introduce multi-level convolutional GRUs, which more efficiently propagate information across the image. A modified version of RAFT-Stereo can perform accurate real-time inference. RAFT-stereo ranks first on the Middlebury leaderboard, outperforming the next best method on 1px error by 29% and outperforms all published work on the ETH3D two-view stereo benchmark."
