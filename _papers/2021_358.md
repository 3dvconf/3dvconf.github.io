abstract: "Recently, methods for learning on 3D point cloud data became ubiquitous due to the popularization of 3D scanning technology and advances of machine learning techniques. Among these methods, point-based shape-generative deep neural networks have been utilized for exploring and optimizing 3D designs. However, most of the computer simulation methods in engineering require high-quality meshed models, which are still challenging to automatically generate from unordered point clouds. In this work, we propose Point2FFD: a novel deep neural network for learning compact geometric representations and generating simulation-ready meshed models. Built upon an autoencoder architecture, Point2FFD learns to compress 3D point cloud data into a latent design space, from which the network generates 3D polygonal meshes by selecting and deforming simulation-ready mesh templates. For a set of benchmark experiments, we show that our proposed network achieves comparable shape-generative performance than existing state-of-the-art engineering deep-generative models. In real world-inspired vehicle aerodynamic optimizations, we also demonstrate that Point2FFD generates simulation-ready meshes with higher fidelity than the benchmark networks and, thus, improve the quality of the optimal results."
