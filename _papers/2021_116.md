title: "Mesh-Based Reconstruction of Dynamic Foam Images Using X-Ray CT"
authors: "Jens Renders, Jan De Beenhouwer and Jan Sijbers"
abstract: "Due to the rapid nucleation and bubble deformation processes that occur during a foam formation process, 4D-CT scans can only record a small number of X-ray projections per rotation. Current dynamic CT imaging methods compute a series of 3D images, which requires a high number of projections per rotation and thus limits the temporal resolution. In this work, we present a new reconstruction method that directly reconstructs a 4D dynamic image, by adapting a set of spherical meshes, representing the foam bubbles, such that the projection distance to the measured projections is minimized. Our method requires little memory, is robust against noise, and yields accurate reconstructions even when only few projections are available, as demonstrated by several experiments on simulated and real data."
