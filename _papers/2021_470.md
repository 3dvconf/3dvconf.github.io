title: "HumanGAN: A Generative Model of Human Images"
authors: "Kripasindhu Sarkar, Lingjie Liu, Vladislav Golyanik and Christian Theobalt"
abstract: "Generative adversarial networks achieve great performance in photorealistic image synthesis in various domains, including human images. However, they usually employ latent vectors that encode the sampled outputs globally. This does not allow convenient control of semantically-relevant individual parts of the image, and cannot draw samples that only differ in partial aspects, such as clothing style. We address these limitations and present a generative model for images of dressed humans offering control over pose, local body part appearance and garment style. This is the first method to solve various aspects of human image generation, such as global appearance sampling, pose transfer, parts and garment transfer, and part sampling jointly in a unified framework. As our model encodes part-based latent appearance vectors in a normalized pose-independent space and warps them to different poses, it preserves body and clothing appearance under varying posture. Experiments show that our flexible and general generative method outperforms task-specific baselines for pose-conditioned image generation, pose transfer and part sampling in terms of realism and output resolution."
