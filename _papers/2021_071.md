title: "Towards Unconstrained Joint Hand-Object Reconstruction From RGB Videos"
authors: "Yana Hasson, Gul Varol, Cordelia Schmid and Ivan Laptev"
abstract: "Our work aims to obtain 3D reconstruction of hands and manipulated objects from monocular videos. Reconstructing hand-object manipulations holds a great potential for robotics and learning from human demonstrations. The supervised learning approach to this problem, however, requires 3D supervision and remains limited to constrained laboratory settings and simulators for which 3D ground truth is available. In this paper we first propose a learning-free fitting approach for hand-object reconstruction which can seamlessly handle two-hand object interactions. Our method relies on cues obtained with common methods for object detection, hand pose estimation and instance segmentation. We quantitatively evaluate our approach and show that it can be applied to datasets with varying levels of difficulty for which training data is currently unavailable."
