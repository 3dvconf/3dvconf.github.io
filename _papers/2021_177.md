title: "Neural Human Deformation Transfer"

abstract: "We consider the problem of human deformation transfer,
where the goal is to retarget poses between different charac-
ters. Traditional methods that tackle this problem require a
clear definition of the pose, and use this definition to trans-
fer poses between characters. In this work, we take a dif-
ferent approach and transform the identity of a character to
a new identity without modifying the characterâ€™s pose. This
offers the advantage of not having to define equivalences
of 3D human poses, which is not straight forward as poses
tend to change depending on the identity of the character
performing it, and as their meaning is highly contextual.
To achieve the deformation transfer, we propose a neural
encoder-decoder architecture where only identity informa-
tion is encoded and where the decoder is conditioned on
the pose. We use pose independent representations, such as
isometry-invariant shape characteristics, to encode identity
features. Our model uses these features to predict offsets
from the deformed pose to the result of the transfer. We
show experimentally that our method outperforms state of
the art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively, and
generalises better to poses not seen during training. We
also introduce a fine-tuning step that allows to obtain com-
petitive results for extreme identities, and allows to transfer
simple clothing."
