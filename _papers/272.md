title: "PLNet: Plane and Line Priors for Unsupervised Indoor Depth Estimation"
authors: "Hualie JIANG, Laiyan Ding, Junjie Hu and Rui Huang"
abstract: "Unsupervised learning of depth from indoor monocular videos is challenging as the artificial environment contains many textureless regions. Fortunately, the indoor scenes are full of specific structures, such as planes and lines, which should help guide unsupervised depth learning. This paper proposes PLNet that leverages the plane and line priors to enhance the depth estimation. We first represent the scene geometry using local planar coefficients and impose the smoothness constraint on the representation. Moreover, we enforce the planar and linear consistency by randomly selecting some sets of points that are probably coplanar or collinear to construct simple and effective consistency losses. To verify the proposed method’s effectiveness, we further propose to evaluate the flatness and straightness of the predicted point cloud on the reliable planar and linear regions. The regularity of these regions indicates quality indoor reconstruction. Extensive experiments on NYU Depth V2 and ScanNet show that PLNet remarkably outperforms existing methods."
