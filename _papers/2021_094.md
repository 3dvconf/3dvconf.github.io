title: "Self-Supervised Light Field Depth Estimation Using Epipolar Plane Images"
authors: "Kunyuan Li, Jun Zhang, Jun Gao and Meibin Qi"
abstract: "Exploiting light field data makes it possible to obtain dense and accurate depth map. However, existing synthetic datasets are usually limited to a small disparity range. By training in synthetic data, the current learning-based methods do not perform well in real scenes. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised learning framework for light field depth estimation. Different from the existing end-to-end training methods using disparity label per pixel, our approach implements network training by estimating EPI disparity shift after refocusing, which extends the disparity range of epipolar lines. To reduce the sensitivity of EPI to noise, we propose a new input mode called EPI-Stack, which stack EPIs in the view dimension. This method is less sensitive to noise scenes than traditional input mode and improves the efficiency of estimation. Compared with other state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method can also obtain higher quality results in real-world scenarios, especially in the complex occlusion and depth discontinuity."
