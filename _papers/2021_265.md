title: "It Is All In The Weights: Robust Rotation Averaging Revisited"
authors: "Sidhartha Chitturi and Venu Madhav Govindu"
abstract: "Rotation averaging is the problem of recovering 3D camera  rotations from a number of pairwise relative rotation estimates. The state-of-the-art method of [5] involves robust averaging in the Lie-algebra of 3D rotations using an  ` 1 2 loss function which is carried out using an iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) minimization. In this paper  we argue that the performance of IRLS-based rotation  averaging is intimately connected with two factors: a) the  nature of the robust loss function used; and b) the initialization.  We make two contributions. Firstly, we analyse  the pitfalls associated with the unbounded  weights in IRLS  minimization of `p(0 < p < 2) loss functions in the context  of rotation averaging. We elucidate the design choices and  modifications implicit to the state-of-the-art method of [5]  that overcomes these problems. Secondly, we argue that the  ` 1  2  -based IRLS method is inflexible in adapting to  the specific noise characteristics of individual datasets, leading to  poorer performance. We remedy this limitation by means of  a Geman-McClure loss function embedded in a graduated  optimization framework. We present results on a number of  large-scale real-world datasets to demonstrate that our proposed  method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms  of both efficiency and accuracy."
