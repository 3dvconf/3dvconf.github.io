title: "PanoDepth: A Two Stage Approach for Monocular Omnidirectional Depth Estimation"
authors: "Yuyan Li, Zhixin Yan, Ye Duan and Liu Ren"
abstract: "Omnidirectional 3D information is essential for a wide
 range of applications such as Virtual Reality, Autonomous
 Driving, Robotics, etc. In this paper, we propose a
 novel, model-agnostic, two-stage pipeline for omnidirectional
 monocular depth estimation. Our proposed framework
 PanoDepth takes one 360 image as input, produces
 one or more synthesized views in the first stage, and feeds
 the original image and the synthesized images into the subsequent
 stereo matching stage. In the second stage, we propose
 a differentiable Spherical Warping Layer to handle
 omnidirectional stereo geometry efficiently and effectively.
 By utilizing the explicit stereo-based geometric constraints
 in the stereo matching stage, PanoDepth can generate dense
 high-quality depth. We conducted extensive experiments
 and ablation studies to evaluate PanoDepth with both the full pipeline as well as the individual modules in each stage. Our results show that PanoDepth outperforms the state-ofthe-art approaches by a large margin for 360 monocular depth estimation."
